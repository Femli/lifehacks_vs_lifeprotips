nic_2000_throwaway,t2_4czlt4qk,1650808835,"I have CPTSD. That's a given. 

I also self sabotage a lot for the last 16 years as one of my coping mechanisms. The obvious solution is to seek mental help, which in my country comes down to either:

* go to church and get saved
* go to mosque
* you sound crazy so I am having you committed
* you sound crazy so I will get you medicated
* I know your family so pay me or I will release this info to them
* release info to outsiders (happens a lot)

And the one person whom I found to be professional charges an arm and a leg. I can only afford 1 session a month. 

My problem is that I start a business, get everything done, and then flake out for no real reason. Sure, sometimes there are external factors, but my response is the same. I just flake, give myself excuses and watch it crash and burn. 

I just started a new business and a supplier and distributor flaked. I want to be done with the whole thing, but I like the business. I don't have the mental tools to make the necessary next decisions to improve my odds of succeeding. What can I do?

Bawonga,t2_2wj9bpoq,1650629522,"\[ True story, not a joke.\] After I got home from a hike, I was sitting at the table and saw a tick embedded in my thigh a few inches from my knee. I assume he was still enjoying his meal (me) because he had sucked enough blood to be sllghtly swollen but not fully engorged. My panic level soared when I saw those whiskery little legs move, knowing that it was up to me to remove him, but I was alone, grossed out, and had never removed a tick before. I remembered hearing something about tweezers and hot matches and vaseline. Sounded like a 3-pronged torture plan worth trying, so I retrieved these from the kitchen and bathroom, returning to the table to sit and worry and begin extraction. But first, I needed to escape from the horror and calm down, so I smoked a joint. 

It was killer weed, and I hit it hard, trying to grow enough courage (actually, it made me more nervous, but now I was smiling and extremely high). What do you know? The little fucker started squirming and backed out of my leg, leaving his feast early. I say ‚Äúearly‚Äù because he hadn‚Äôt filled up with enough blood to swell up like a woman pregnant with quintuplets. After nudging him onto a piece of paper with the end of the tweezers, I ran (fast) to the bathroom and flushed him down the toilet. Side note: I didn‚Äôt use that toilet for about a week, certain he‚Äôd climb back to finish his meal. ‚Ä¶ So, my theory is that a safe (and fun!) way to remove an embedded tick is to get it super high so he leaves on his own accord, however, I haven‚Äôt found another ~~victim~~ tick trying to feed on me again to test the theory. If anyone else tries it out, I‚Äôd love to hear whether the tick got stoned, or just you.",Tick removal hack -- smoke a joint,lifehacks,False,0,1,1.0

I also live in a hot environment (Austin), ride a bike 3-4 days a week for fitness (and sweat profusely while doing so) and drink alcohol‚Äîall bad when it comes to staying hydrated.

I know all of the benefits of drinking enough water (better digestion, better skin, better sleep, less anxiety, weight loss, avoidance of kidney stones, etc.) and I've seen people with those massive containers sitting on their desk, but somehow that has never motivated me. There's ""the knowing"" and then there's ""the doing""‚Äîwe can all struggle with this gap at times, right?

About a week ago I remembered having read an article about the benefits of drinking apple cider vinegar and so I tried it by pouring about a half an inch into a pint glass and then topping it off with water. Despite the ratio it was pretty tough to drink so every chance I had to further dilute the mixture I did so by adding more water. 90 minutes later I had easily downed three pints of water‚Äîwhich is a great start to having a good day hydration-wise.

I've done it every day since and I've lost weight, my digestion has improved and I'm sleeping better. I know there are some potential drawbacks to drinking apple cider vinegar long-term but maybe I can establish a good water drinking habit before I have to give it up.

When my children were little, we battled staphylococcal infections. They would get a mosquito bite or a little rug burn‚Ä¶next morning boom! Abscess. To the pediatrician for local anesthetic and an attempt to drain before hospitalization became necessary. I cleaned and bleached daily until exhaustion trying to kill that stuff off surfaces in my home. This was a 3.5 year fight for their lives!!! Bleach baths, washing linens daily, doorknobs etc etc. I wish I would have known then what I know now. I‚Äôve been using an HOCl maker in my house for a few months. Research proves this is the most effective disinfectant on so many levels. You can humidify rooms with it. (Cover electronics!) wash foods (no rinse needed!) clean your skin especially eyes, put in laundry, clean surfaces, bathe pets and it goes on and on. It‚Äôs not harmful in any aspect to us or animals! There is no chemical smells or worry of skin irritation. It kills tons of viruses, bacteria, fungi even parvovirus, staphylococcus and covid!!! I always concerned about chemicals leaving toxic residue around the house and that is no longer a problem. If you work in the medical field, this is a perfect safe way to help keep your home environment safe. It‚Äôs also super cost efficient!! Buying an HOCl maker can range from $80- $300. I bought mine for $120 and it will pay for itself in just months! I just wanted to share this because what I went through years ago was draining and I felt hopeless.

babib652,t2_a1wi6akt,1650423613,"So my apartment building is about 40 years old, and the water heater in the Apartment is the SAME one since it was first built. About a year ago the heating elements blew out on it. They replace it, 3-4 months later it blows out, etc. Rinse and repeat about 4-5 times. Finally it goes out and that's it. They try to change the heating element for the 5th time to hold me over another 3-4 months but, no luck. That 40 year old water heater has finally passed away after decades of reliable service. 

Now for whatever reason, water heaters are NOT easy to come by lately. After the guys left they said they'd have to back-order one. Seriously, you can't just go to lowes or something and grab one? It has to be back-ordered?! OK whatever.

So in the meantime i've been taking these ice cold showers for the past 2 weeks. Here's how i did it without losing my mind. 

Step #1- Angle showerhead directly downward. 

Step #2- Sit down in the shower, knees all together, in tightly huddled position.

Step #3- Brace yourself. 1....2...3....

Step #4- TURN THAT BITATCH ON FULL-BLAST, PAIN IS FOR DA WEAK!!

Step #5- ENDURE IT! ""AAARRGGGHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!"" And give it about 4-5 searing, ice-cold minutes. 

\^\^ Kinda like jumping into swimming pools as a kid, you know it's gonna be cold as frak at first but, you learn to just dive in and let your body get desensitized to it. And it's like my mind would block out the transition points. I remember one moment i'd go from shaking uncontrollably as i was blasted by the Arctic streams, to calmly contemplating about how i'll handle issues at work. 

So after nearly 2 weeks, i get a text from my apartment office manager that they'll be over tomorrow morning to install a new water heater. Holy hell.",Water-heater broken: How to take ice-cold showers consistently without losing your mind....,lifehacks,False,0,1,1.0
ThatOneEpicAstronaut,t2_l3qbkvhk,1650421545,"**TL;DR:**  
The reason behind this is kinda personal, so I won't say it. In the past (I think last month), I was able to wake up at 3:00 AM continuously every single day without sunlight and alarm. Only pure motivation and repetition. But nowadays, even with my old method, I still can't wake up on time. I have tried repeating it every single day, but it doesn't work now. There are some days where I am very motivated that I even woke up at 2:00 AM or 3:00 AM, but after that, I don't anymore. I tried 4:00 AM, and I woke up at 5:00 AM. I really need to do master this, so please don't give comments like ""You need to get 8 hours of sleep"", ""Just keep doing it (That's not the purpose of this post)"", ""Try this app \_\_\_"", ""Use an alarm clock"", ""get someone to wake you up"", ""Put your phone on the other side of the room"", etc.  


Again, the reasons are kinda personal. I would really like to hear your thoughts/tips/advice about this one, thank you!  


**Extra:**  
I always exercise after I wake up to stay awake, that's why in the past, even without an alarm clock &amp; sunlight, I can still wake up with full energy.

ilustrado,t2_i5cl1,1649948711,"I used ExpressVPN for this since my main VPN (Mullvad) doesn't have an Indian server yet. You can even use a free VPN for this if you want, since you'll be using fake information anyway and won't risk anybody eavesdropping on the payment to get your card details.  


1.) Connect to Indian VPN using your provider of choice.

  
2.) Use Firefox, not Chrome. Chrome, for whatever reasons, does not work (likely due to the data Google collects on you)

  
3.) Download Privacy on your phone (No VPN needed on your phone). From their website: 

&gt;Privacy gives you control over who can charge you  and how much. Create virtual payment cards for one-time purchases or  subscriptions, directly from your browser or phone. Set spend limits, pause,  unpause, and close cards any time you want. 

*Full disclosure, this is my affiliate URL. I'm not going to try and be sneaky and just hyperlink it here, but the only reason why I include it is you do get a $5 credit applied to your account if you accept someone else's invite, and since I'm sharing this method, I'd appreciate anybody using it. If you don't want to for whatever reason, no hard feelings, just remove the code at the end:* [**https://www.privacy.com/join/MNSNG**](https://www.privacy.com/join/MNSNG)

4.) After linking your card, generate a disposable debit card with a set spending limit of what you expect to pay (I usually just choose $5, and it'll get charged the $1 for the month, then you can close the card if you want. Or, just select a prepaid 3/6 month plan and adjust the cards limit accordingly.) If you don't do this, it's very likely your card will be declined by your bank.  


5.)  Go to [youtube.com/premium](https://youtube.com/premium) and notice that it is now displaying the price in Indian Rupees, 129 a month. That converts to 1.69 (nice) a month. 

6.) Input your Privacy card details on checkout, and for address, just use any random address from [https://www.bestrandoms.com/random-address-in-in](https://www.bestrandoms.com/random-address-in-in)  
7.) You should get redirected to a page that says your card is not from india, so the payment processor may charge your card a few extra cents. It'll convert the price to USD and show you before you pay.  


8.) Complete the payment,  and enjoy your dirt-cheap premium!  


Some  may see this as unethical, but I find it extremely ethical. Frankly, you're already paying more than you think with all the data Google collects and sells about you. To have non-stop ads on every video you watch is just Google being greedy.   


This method has been around for a very, very long time, and nobodies been banned for it. The address does not need to be connected to your debit card, and due to a lack of KYC, it's all irrelevant information anyway. Some people claim to have just input obviously fake information, or their real information with an indian zip code, etc etc, and it still works.  


Just thought I'd share since I just got 3 months for $4 and couldn't be happier! Everything is working flawlessly. If you're \*really\* concerned about repercussions, you're free to make a new account ,but people have reported using this for years and absolutely no issues. You're free to disconnect your VPN immediately after payment and your Premium will still be active even on your home connection.","Want YouTube Premium, but don't want to spend the ridiculous $12 a month?

I‚Äôm 31. My whole life I‚Äôve had a toxic relationship with credit cards, as do many people. Dig yourselves in a deep hole at 18 that you can‚Äôt get out of. These past few months I‚Äôve paid off some, and a couple more to go, but while thinking differently about it.   

Bills in general would come due various times throughout the month, so to keep track I would heavily use my phones calendar to plot those dates. It was stressful to coincide income to those dates. Internet is due the 12th, oh but we get paid four days later! I did this for my 13 adult years. Very exhausting.

I then had a conversation with someone and they pay their bills by setting autopay to one or two cards for most things they got - internet, cell, rent, etc. they don‚Äôt have forty bills to remember, only about two or three. The more that‚Äôs automated, the more you can avoid the headache of planning, plus everything is paid on time. Ensure you pay balance by statement time and you avoid interest fees.

An addition to this revelation can be further exploited by applying for new cards that offer cash back. I got a Wells Fargo card and for every dollar spent, 2.2% is kicked back (minus gambling and advanced transfers). Math says for my monthly expenses of $4,161 (excl those that credit card can‚Äôt pay) x 2.2% x 12 months means a cool $1,098 a year in rewards. That‚Äôs a good round trip pair of flights.

feeverdreemer,t2_4s423nw6,1649442802,"I've tried tongue scraping, tongue brushing, hydrating more throughout the day, and mouthwash. Nothing works as well as sour candy.

I have a pretty big sweet tooth and LOVE Sweetarts. They are sweet, sour, crunchy....just the perfect treat. After sucking on a handful a few weeks ago I noticed that my tongue looked perfectly pink! I usually have an issue with my tongue looking white and couldn't figure out how to fix it. But after I eat about ten Sweetarts my white tongue issue is gone and my tongue stays perfectly pink for about 3 days afterwards!

This morning my tongue was white again so I re-tested this discovery and after a handful of Sweetarts this afternoon, my tongue feels cleaner and looks pinker!

I'm guessing the sourness in candy must kill off something on the surface of the tongue. My only reccomendation is Sweetarts from direct experience but I'm sure you could try other candies too.","Suffer from ""white tongue""? Try sour candy!",lifehacks,False,0,1,1.0

We push it room-to-room. Need to vacuum? Push the cart. See a trash item in that room or something that needs to be dusted? Just toss it in the trash or grab the duster! We have a 2 year old who is a sock thief &amp; this has helped with keeping track of our socks.

Unfortunately they're also small enough to get past our magnetic screens, we've previously sprayed mortein fly spray over these areas but they seem to keep coming back!

SPon23567,t2_3x73kndk,1648980256,"This is a bit of an interesting little life hack that nets you free food, condiments, desserts, and whathaveyou. 

The restaurant City Barbeque always has a giant backstock of sauce, desserts, whipped cream (like actual whipped cream not the canned stuff), and even drinks like sweet tea. Around 15min to closing or at closing you can often arrive and ask if they have anything they are going to toss that you could take home instead, and they will just hand you a shite ton of sauce or whipped cream or whatever. 

If you need or want food and can't afford it for a short time, and want to help cut down on the amount of waste being put in landfills AND wasted food (because otherwise they just literally throw it in the trash), you can always show up and ask them if they are able to give you anything they planned to toss. 

Other places like wing zone/wingstop often have sweet tea they plan to chuck and you can just ask them. On one occaision I went home with 9 containers of sauce and whipped cream free from CB and on another they sent us home with literally 6 tubs of peach cobbler. 

This is legit a useful lifehack because many people do not know that businesses will often let customers take home certain items they would otherwise end up throwing out. You just need to ask politely and make sure that the staff do not have a policy against it.","Several restaurants give away free food around closing time, and it is awesome...",lifehacks,False,0,1,1.0

YouAreAGoodDogDug,t2_keydf0zo,1648702382,"There are several reasons why a bed could require changing during the night ‚Ä¶and it‚Äôs extra hard to do when you‚Äôve been yanked out of Dreamland.   There‚Äôs something you can do to make changing those sheets easy, no matter what the time!  Make the bed in layers that can be taken off to reveal clean sheets.  Here‚Äôs how:  Put a waterproof mattress pad down, make the bed as usual with sheets.  Add another waterproof mattress pad or waterproof pads and add another set off sheets.  When there‚Äôs a late night accident, you will simply remove the wet sheets and waterproof mattress pad and voila!  A clean, made bed, ready for using.  

If you want to make the bed, so that multiple accidents can happen without changing the sheets, consider buying one size larger sheet sets for the upper layers.  This will accommodate the extra size of the multiple sheet sets underneath them.  

For kids who provide wet spots consistently in the same place, consider using a draw sheet with doggy pee pads (unscented) underneath.  Place a doggy pee pad where the spot is expected then take a top sheet and fold it in half, lengthwise.  Put the folded sheet over the pee pad and tuck the sides in on both sides of the bed, so that the sheet is snug, keeping the pee pad in place.  Scotch tape can also be used to keep pads in place.",Changing Sheets at ‚ÄúWee‚Äù Hours of the Morning?,lifehacks,False,0,1,1.0

If you ever accidentally burn your finger(s) &amp;/or hand, grab yourself any type of rubber glove (improvise with cling wrap, etc. if need be), put the glove on your hand that's suffering from the burns, and get plain yellow mustard (if you don't have yellow mustard, ketchup can also work as a substitute) and squirt an excessive amount all on the inside of the glove to where it's saturated. Keep the glove on for upwards of an hour, and once you take it off, I can 100% guarantee that you will have no pain, no residual scarring, &amp; will be thanking me later.

A couple months back, my mom was over at my place, and I don't quite remember what she was doing, but some type of chemical liquid got too hot, and it poured out &amp; onto her fingers. She was in pain for around 20 minutes, trying everything from aloe vera, to ice, to cold water to sooth the burn, especially since the burn was starting to bubble up. After I realized nothing was working and she was thinking about maybe having to go to the ER, I remembered this hack I learned many years ago - needless to say, it literally saved her finger, stopped the pain, and prevented her finger(s) from being possibly disfigured &amp;/or scarred, &amp; from enduring 2nd/3rd degree burns.  My Mom likes to remind me often how if it wasn't for me and my mustard in a glove trick, that her finger would be f*ck#! off!

SrtDior,t2_b3th857f,1647942889,"I‚Äôm making this post because I want to hold myself accountable

I‚Äôm 23 years old currently working as a bouncer. I‚Äôve spent so much time working and I barely have anything to show for it. My life right now is literally smoking hella weed, gambling, partying taking girls on dates for drinks and occasionally some drugs.

It‚Äôs a fast lifestyle and sounds like a good time for anybody my age group but I couldn‚Äôt feel any emptier.

Yesterday I went out with a couple I met at my job and I took a girl on a date with me. The night consisted of throwing money at strippers at a huge strip club, drinking as much as we wanted too cuz  we got free bottles, the couple also brought some cocaine and MDMA so we indulged in a bit of that too.  And of course sex with this girl on hella drugs after 

Sounds like a good time right?
Wrong 
My mind felt like it was in a very dark place and I felt my vibration was super low something didn‚Äôt feel right at all.

I remember just driving home with my head hanging low and just feeling super defeated for some reason.

I think the reason is I know the potential I have for myself I‚Äôve been able to accomplish a lot and have really good jobs 

My problems all come with discipline, I have no balance when it comes to doing things. 
I‚Äôll get as high as I possibly can, I‚Äôll gamble all the money to my name, I‚Äôll not show up to jobs just because my mind feels a bit wrong

I‚Äôm done living like this I‚Äôm cutting out the small minded people out of my life and I‚Äôm getting selfish about investing in myself as much as I can in any way possible.

I come from the warmest sweetest parents you could ever meet. They raised me with such great morals, they represent hard work respect and loyalty.

My parents are getting older every single day they still both work Monday-Friday and im here barely working 3 days in the week. What the f*** kind of selfish bs is that. 

I see many people in my age group living like this and thinking it‚Äôs perfectly ok. That could never be f****ng me. God put me in this earth for a greater purpose than to just be self depleting myself all day and he blessed me with many great traits.

I have no excuses whatsoever. I‚Äôve had the pretty girls, I‚Äôve droven the dope cars, I‚Äôve met hella celebrities, I‚Äôve been to the best parties Miami has to offer.
Nothing makes me feel emptier every time than these temporary pleasures.

Real happiness to me is getting a workout, making myself a healthy meal, reading books, going out to the beach catching sunlight, accomplishing task that I know are gonna help me have a better tomorrow. Things like that have always made me not excited but fulfilled. True genuine happiness not dopamine from drugs

If your still reading anybody have some advice for me maybe? Regardless I‚Äôm making this change no matter what I‚Äôm tired of the lifestyle I‚Äôve been leading when I know the lifestyle I‚Äôm able to achieve.

Alexdandanalex,t2_1n8bzqoq,1647889643,"Hello, all! 

Almost all the music I've listened to since my adolescence were through sub-$10 checkout isle headphones. The main problems these headphones suffer from is cheap construction (tons of resonant space in the earphone itself/shotty connections) and excessive midrange (specifically the 500hz band).

Open the eq app on your phone/streaming platform and eq out the 500hz band by -15(ish)dB, and the 250hz and 1000hz bands by a quarter of that amount. Play around with the EQ to dial in the sound. I recommend using the aux in your car for reference. Switch between your headphones and the stereo and try to match the sound of the stereo EQ'd flat (all parameters at zero) to the sound of the headphones. 

This isn't going to make them sound like Sennheisers, but 5 minutes careful EQing can make a $5.00 pair of headphones sound like a $30.00 pair. When I was on a shoestring budget, that difference made my day a little nicer :). I've also heard of people stuffing the headphone cavity (the area behind the speakers) with cotton to nix most of the resonance. 

Hope this helps in a tiny way!",Simple way to considerably improve the sound quality of cheap headphones:,lifehacks,False,0,1,1.0

FunDecision3,t2_42rxwxom,1647878633,"Hello everyone,

It's been about 2+ years this was not washed and the fiberglass has become extremely yellow tainted. I have tried colgate, sandpaper with soap with little results still looks very yellow. I have not tried a power drill yet but have tried manually with sandpaper for over 10 minutes with little results.

Are there any other solutions to fix this problem?

1. **Soup A Little Too Salty** \-  Instead of throwing it out, take a potato and cut it open. Place it in the soup, and that potato will absorb the extra salt.
2. **Make Your Flowers Last Longer** \- you can add a little vinegar and sugar to the vase and then pour in the water. Place the flowers in the vase after this, and they should last a little longer.
3. **Freeze Your Onions**
4. **Get Rid of Scratches** \- Take a walnut and rub it over all the scratches. The nuts‚Äô natural oil will decrease the visibility of the scratches.
