BigOlBlimp,t2_53c1t8bg,1651178589,"Lots of people think blower hand dryers aren't effective or don't get your hands completely dry, this is because they're using them improperly. Wipe the remaining water around your hands (same motion as when you're washing them) to maintain a roughly even level of moisture across the surface during the drying process and your hands will quickly become completely dry all over.

This works because if you hold your hands still in front of the blower, only part of them gets hit directly by the air, causing that part to dry and nowhere else. If you keep them moving and continuously wipe the remaining water onto the sides of your hands that naturally get the most air, you'll most efficiently and effectively dry that remaining water.

What worked for me (and many friends/family that have followed) is to focus first on spending a full hour ***every day*** in the gym. For the first couple weeks, only let yourself use the treadmill… start off walking, but make sure you spend the full hour in the gym ***every single day.***

It may feel silly to go to the gym and not sweat, but I promise that if you’re consistent this will work. 

After a couple days you’ll probably notice that you want to do a little more than just walk for an hour… maybe you start challenging yourself see how many miles you can fit into the hour. 

Eventually (once the hour EVERY DAY) becomes part of your normal routine, you’ll find yourself actively wanting to try other exercises to fill up your gym time, ***and it will be enjoyable.***

Start will the lowest weights you can. It will feel silly to bench press 5-10lb dumbbells at first, but again… you’ll find yourself wanting the additional challenge later. 

Then you might start challenging yourself to eat better, as to not ruin all the work you’ve been putting in at the gym. 

Do this and you’ll notice a change within a couple weeks. Those close to you will notice in about 4 weeks. And 6-8weeks in and your body will really start to show major progress.

When we get tired, our first instinct is usually to quit or withdraw altogether. But sometimes, a good rest is all that we need.

And even after sleeping 9-10 hours of sleep, if you are feeling tired, you might try one these 7 different types of rest:

✅ Physical Rest: This is your body telling you that you need to slow down. Think sleeping, taking a nap, doing some light stretching…  
 ✅ Emotional Rest: We all carry heavy emotional loads on our shoulders. Do you have someone around you who might help you carry yours?  
 ✅ Social Rest: Sartre was right. Sometimes, hell is other people! You might use some me-time to recharge.  
 ✅ Mental Rest: Staring blankly at the same page for 10 minutes straight? You might need a mental break. Get away from that task.  
 ✅ Creative Rest: You are not what you create. Allow yourself to just take in the beauty around you, instead of constantly striving to create something of your own.  
 ✅ Spiritual Rest: Don’t necessarily think of a religious one. Just try to get re-connected to the bigger picture in your life.  
 ✅ Sensory Rest: Minimize the sensory inputs around you. Close your laptop, put aside your phone and go for a walk.

Add to all this that my Social Security Office isn't open to the public still, (unless it's an immigration issue), and I had to do all of this via the phone, (3 hours on hold, each time, on average), or online. It was such a nightmare, (including my puppy chewing up my Legal Copy of my Marriage Certificate), that could have been avoided, had I just changed my name with Social Security right after I got married. I had no idea.

I ended up getting a signed note from my Dr, stating that I am in fact, me, along with the rest of my paperwork. I also learned that Social Security will accept a signed Dr's note, verifying your identity.

They agree to delete data as their policy around it hugely affects their reputation and brand trust. **It's a fantastic leap forward and practically everyone can clean their data now**.

*What to do?*

A good practice here is to delete your data from any services you no longer use — every day your data is stored on their servers, the greater the risk of a data breach / third-party access.

*How to do it?*

1. You can send deletion requests manually by going to the privacy policies of companies, and ""guess"" who holds your data based on your email history. But it's very time-consuming and not so efficient.
2. The automatic solution I've found is to use [Mine](https://saymine.com/). There are plenty of tools that do the same, I chose this one because it has the largest user base (not affiliated with it, do what you wish). These kinds of tools show you which companies have your data and let you send deletion requests kinda fast, and that’s exactly what I did for 85% of my digital footprint.

RealBeany,t2_i1vjzcuh,1650983576,"Fabric softener and dryer sheets leave a film of wax on your clothes. Something I noticed a long time ago is people who use a lot tend to have more problems with acne and more problems with dirt and smells clinging to their clothes or problems with their clothes not washing very thoroughly clean. You don't need it, it doesn't do anything good, it just leaves a film on them and in the drum of your dryer. You especially don't want it on your pillowcase if you have problems with acne.

Ever wonder how your clothes still smell like flowers after they've been washed? Or ever used a laundromat and noticed that black gum-like buildup in the drum of the dryer? That's wax. Your clothes won't breathe as they should, you'll have more problems with b.o. dirt will cling and water and soap will have a more difficult time penetrating the fibers and eventually your clothes will smell like ""you"" not matter how much you wash them. Its a huge waste of money, but I know a lot of people who refuse to believe it causes any problems because that's just how they've always done laundry and think it's essential for some reason. Also, something I've seen that's very common is using too much soap and not leaving enough room in the washer for your clothes to agitate. Especially at the laundromat I've seen people stuff the washer so full and tight with clothing that you could see the center of the compressed ball of clothes wasn't even getting wet. For really dirty clothes, especially if you work around oil or grease is hot water, a cap full of Dawn, a splash of ammonia and enough room for them to agitate. Dawn (Joy, Ajax whatever) dish soap is fine to use in a washer in small amounts without Brady Bunch level ridiculous suds filling the house and it actually rinses clean without leaving a film. It's also really good for people with allergies to laundry detergents.",LPT: Don't use fabric softener or dryer sheets on your clothes/linens/towels.,LifeProTips,False,1,1,1.0

Until I got some great advice from a friend: “Keep a set of clippers with you at all times.”

So I found a 10-pack of fingernail clippers online, and now I keep them everywhere: my car, my bedroom, my key-ring, etc. If I ever find myself reaching up for a quick nibble, I pull out the clippers and snip off the longer parts. This has been the ONLY thing I’ve ever done that’s helped me stop the habit.

wiseoldmeme,t2_11rpai,1650981733,"This just happened to me. I bought some furniture with a 0% interest for 2 years promotion. The catch on all of these types of promotions is that if you don’t pay it off before the promotion expires you get hit with all the interest accrued since you made the purchase. The real interest rate is always some ungodly number you dont pay attention to when you are enticed by a promotion like this. I figured I would make 24 equal payments and take advantage of this promotion and it seemed so easy. So i set up my autopay which showed me that if I paid the minimum payment, which happened to be my total divided by 24 exactly then I would pay off this loan before the promotion expired. Great. So I set my autopay to ‘minimum payment’ and proceeded to forget all about this loan for the next two years. I am guessing that some of you already know where I fucked up. So I’m a busy guy I have a family and my credit card bill is usually very long and I tend not to keep track of repeating payments if I think that I’ve already got them all squared away. What I didn’t notice was that over time the ‘minimum payment’ for this loan was decreasing. So when 24 months had passed I had not in fact paid off this loan. I didn’t realize this. I had completely forgotten how many months had gone by. I knew in the back of my head this loan should be expiring soon so the next email statement I received i actually opened it (which I never do). I was flabbergasted to see not only was the loan not almost paid off but my balance had increased by over $2500. I had passed the 24 month mark and since the loan was not paid off I was hit with all of the interest. What I should’ve done when I set up my auto pay was to specifically type in how much I wanted to pay each month. Selecting ‘minimum balance’ screwed me. Now, I was very fortunate As I caught my fuck up within 30 days of the date when the interest hit my account. I was able to negotiate with the bank to pay off my loan without all of that additional interest. If I hadn’t noticed within 30 days I would’ve been on the hook for it all.",LPT when taking advantage of a 0% interest loan make sure not to use ‘minimum payment’ option on autopay.,LifeProTips,False,1,1,1.0

No_Salamander_6579,t2_8s3w7rhx,1650975268,"The younger you are, the better! Live at your parents so you can weather the occasional bad month? Even better. Sales is inarguably the quickest way to make the most money from an entry level perspective when joining a company. What’s even better, you can parlay this level of earnings into better positions with more guaranteed pay down the road. Once you’ve established that level of earnings. For example, if you make 75k (salary + commission) on a sales job that pays $30k salary, you could start looking for the next job that offers $75k salary plus commissions. Or a job that doesn’t involve sales at all, but you now have the experience and W2 (American version of tax slip confirming annual earnings) to negotiate that level of salary. 

To any of you reading thinking “But I hate sales.” Or “I could never sell anything.” More than likely, what you hate is the “perception” of what you think a sales person is. Are there some people who are slimy stereotypical “car salesman”? Of course. But really how you should approach sales is identifying what a customer’s problem is and how you could resolve that problem with your product/service. And if you can demonstrate some ROI (return on investment) with your solution, be it financial or other means, to that customer? Perfection. That should even be part of your pitch when meeting with clients - “I don’t really have much interest trying to “sell” you anything, but if you give me a list of your pain points as a business, I’d love to see if we could help fix some of your issues with our products.” 

How to get hired? 
Sales is unique in that you really don’t need to have any tangible skills, you just need to be able to communicate. In any interview setting (again, this is geared towards entry level - some sales jobs can be very technical and require several levels of experience) be sure to hit on the following points when describing yourself:

You’re a head hunter - you get a thrill chasing down new business.
You’re a team player - you’ll do whatever is asked, a collection of ideas is always better than just your own. 
You have an insatiable thirst for learning - of your product, of the sales process, of human nature and people in general. You are very coachable and welcome critique, as you feel it will only help you become a better sales person (which means more money!)

How do you make a sale?
It really comes down to three easy questions:
What are your pain points/ reasons for us meeting today? (*If lead given appointment, not pounding pavement generating new business). 

Who all is involved in the decision process? If they mention anyone other than themself, ask when that person would be available to ensure you’re all on the same page (This helps you identify who will actually be signing the check , so you don’t waste time on middle men with no real actual decision making ability). 

What is your budget and timeline for this project? This helps you quantify the opportunity. 

Can sales be hard? 
YES! Full stop. People will waste your time, give your business away at the last minute, and occasionally lie to your face. But you know what else can be hard? Literally every other job, with a fraction of the pay, and no room for advancement. It’s not for everyone BUT everyone can do it. So if you aren’t happy with your current earnings, what do you have to lose?

There are countless vertical markets that hire entry level sales positions. Nothing in life is guaranteed, but if you hit on the points above in the interview, and keep those three questions in mind on every sales call, there’s a strong chance you will get the job and do well! Good luck and go get em!

**Define yourself and your career narrative**: Everything else follows from this. Who are you? What do you want to do next? We can all better define the narrative of our career and that takes practice and refinement.

One of the most disappointing interviews of my career was an early post-grad interview where the interviewer straight up told me that she couldn't make sense of my story. Sure, I studied a lot and could possibly do a lot of things, but I was so disordered in my self-story that she just couldn't figure out what I'd be able to do for her team.

Don't be me. Define your narrative. What does that mean? Simply put, it means being able to say succinctly who you are and what you bring. For instance in my case: ""I'm a partnerships leader who helps run teams who develop new partnerships, lead deal negotiations, and serve as the organizational glue between internal and external stakeholders."" I obviously provide more, but for what I do that gets me the first five minutes of attention.

The more you practice defining yourself and your story the more confident you will be. There is no shame in introspection.

**Resumes are tricky, so don't hesitate to get yours scrutinized:** Resumes suck. They all suck. They're a way oversimplified distillation of everything you do, but they're often the first look someone has at who you are. Make sure your resume speaks to your narrative of who you are, but most importantly: DON'T LEAVE ANY TYPOS. You have no idea how many resumes I've reviewed with obvious glaring typos. Please, don't do that.

**Make your public persona shine:** I realize that not everyone is on LinkedIn, but everyone has an online presence to some degree now. I STRONGLY recommend having a high-quality LinkedIn profile if you are applying to any “office-type” job. I look at the LinkedIn profiles of everyone I interview and look for any additional context about that person compared to their resume. I don’t think everyone needs to have the best LinkedIn profile ever, but don’t skimp on having your LinkedIn tell a consistent story about who you are and what you’re capable of doing. Trust me, both recruiters and hiring manager will pay attention. And please make your photo flattering-- if you can, pay for a professional headshot. Worst case it becomes your Slack icon.

**Practice interviewing with alumni or friends with more work experience:** Most colleges/universities provide at least some access to alumni who are willing to help mentor you in your career. Take advantage of that and do mock interviews. Tons of them. Get feedback, be humbled and take the time to be introspective as you get feedback. Not all of it will be equally helpful, but treat it like you would any other interview and hear out the mock interviewer and their feedback for you. One fun bit of advice I got early? Stop biting my cuticles in interviews. Yep. That was a fun one to get. And since then I've learned to apply some hydrocortisone to my fingertips that are peeling so I have less of an urge to nibble. Little things, eh?

**Please don't slack off with recruiters:** Recruiter screens might seem like a formality but they're really not. Recruiters can be your best advocate or they can push to have you nixed early. They are an important first and last step in the process. Do NOT think they're simply there to read your resume and ask questions. They often help the hiring manager from start to finish and can have tons of power over your hiring process.

**There is no perfect job, there is only the right job for right now:** I have worked for some of the coolest, best-known companies on Earth. And I've left every one of them at some point. There is no perfect job, no perfect boss, no perfect role. Don't think that because you didn't get something this time that you are any less worthy. I got told multiple times at one job that I wasn't a people manager. I now manage people. I've been told I wasn't a partnership manager. I'm now a director-level partnerships manager. I've been told I don't know how to manage software lifecycle. I now help manage huge gaming franchise lifecycles.

Above all: it's just a job. No job will ever be perfect, and it's okay to not get it right now. There's always another job.

So when you truly and deeply mean ""No."" then you should say exactly and ***only*** that: ""No.""

eren_yeagermeister,t2_4a8yvtju,1650901306,"As a musician and performer, I want to address something that has been bothering me that I hope people will understand. It has to do with complimenting musicians. One of the most common phrases I hear after a concert, or performance, or release is ""why are you doing x (like playing in a bar)?"" And ""why aren't you famous yet?""   While I understand that it is meant as a compliment and meant to show the idea of ""you have talent, how is it possible you haven't gotten the recognition you deserve?"", the way it really comes across is ""what you're doing isn't good enough"".  

For example, I'm a teacher. I love educating. I also love performing. So when someone says ""why are you stuck HERE and not doing THIS"", it implies that I've made wrong choices and haven't tried my best.  ALL musicians are trying their best. So when people ask ""why aren't you famous?"", it really makes us feel like we haven't lived up to our potential. No one likes to feel that. It reminds us of failure and lost or unavailable opportunity. 

I felt this a lot when I was doing dueling pianos. Every night, and I'm sure my other dueling friends will attest to this, people will ALWAYS ask ""why are you in a place like this?"". As if I wouldn't take an opportunity of something much bigger if it wasn't presented. It's disingenuous and discouraging. 

So I ask any time you see a musician or performer that impresses you, just compliment their ability. Don't question to them why they are where they are as if it's not good enough for you.  Give positive reinforcement. Let them know their merit speaks for itself and it doesn't matter if they're playing for tips in a bar or performing on national TV. Support us for where we are.

epicllama0,t2_ih1tniyv,1650888668," Looking for a summer job this year? Here are a few words of advice.

If you come in person to interview or just to get an application, dress nice. Not saying you need a suit and tie to apply for a lifeguard position, but wear decent pants and a nicer shirt (ie: a polo shirt), not ripped jeans and a dirty ""420 YOLO SWAG"" shirt.

When you are talking to people look them in the eyes and engage them. I can't tell you how many people come in to apply for a job and look at their shoes the entire time and mumble responses to my questions.

Make sure your application is readable. I have shit for hand writing but when I was filling out applications it looked like I got an A+ in hand writing class. If I can't read it, I won't hire you. On the same vein, answer ALL the questions. Don't leave half the application blank and expect anyone to call you back.

Put the cell phone away. If you are waiting for someone that is fine, but when someone is talking to you put it away and don't bring it out again until you leave.

If you have questions about hiring, the position, or if there is any word on your application make sure that it is you that is calling, not mom or dad. It is a sign of maturity and that you are responsible enough to follow up yourself. It is a huge red flag if mom is calling me every day to ask questions for you or to push me to give you a job.

source: I do HR at a decent size country club and have been doing the hiring for the last few years and have reviewed more than enough terrible applications and candidates.

Will add some extra good advice as well:

\*Use a blue or black pen to fill out an application.

\*Don't bring friends with you to apply.

\*Have a professional email address, not [fingerbanger666@gmail.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20130523070931/mailto:fingerbanger666@gmail.com)

\*If possible hand an application to the manager not an employee.

\*Don't show up when we are running around like mad people expecting anyone to talk to you or remember you.

\*Don't apply too early (we forget about the application) or too late. Try and think of a reasonable time to apply, sorry it is vague advice.

\*Don't be late and don't have a poor excuse.

\*Know how to shake someone's hand.

\*Be confident when you are applying in person.

\*Be polite!",LPT: School ended for the year and you are applying for summer jobs? A few words of advice from HR.,LifeProTips,False,1,1,1.0

jgwentworth-877,t2_dy9jw,1650883697,"Back in the early 2000s when I was around 8 and my cousin was 18, he'd sometimes take me to get McDonalds. One day he tried heating his up the next morning and about 2 bites in declared to the world ""okay, heated up McDonalds is officially BAD"". 

I took this declaration as gospel because he was older and cooler than me. I lived by those words for twenty years and they were etched into my brain as a Rule of the Land, spoken by a wise man in my formative years.

As time went on and I experienced life as a broke college student got more conscious about wasting food and would occasionally give it a try. Maybe they'd changed their recipe. Maybe the fries just needed more salt. Nope, heated up McDonalds was, still, officially BAD. I'd mentally kick myself for questioning the Holy Gospel until the next time my empty wallet got the better of me. 

Until yesterday. I stumbled across a life hack, nothing complicated, nothing special. Just one line.

""You can save heated up McDonalds if you put it in the microwave with half a mug of water, it'll come out crispy"".

By chance my partner's mom had gotten a discount family meal at McDonalds just that night and I had a burger and half a bag of fries in the fridge I was ready to test my luck with. Today was the day. Everything I thought I knew about the world was on the line. I put my burger and fries on a plate, filled half a mug with water and placed it in the center. 50 seconds. Would the law finally be broken? Would this forever change the rule of the land?

I sat down and took a bite. Took another few bites to be sure. And I have to say I've reached a disappointing verdict, the law still holds true. It is BAD.

So my question is, is there any way to salvage heated up McDonalds? Did I fuck up the mug trick somehow? Or is this just a tried and true fact of life I need to truly accept after 23 years?",LPT Request: Is there any way to salvage heated up McDonalds?,LifeProTips,False,1,1,1.0

alfredo0spallina,t2_ifti5eyd,1650880117," The Federal Trade Commission (FTC), the nation's consumer protection agency, is warning consumers to be on the alert for scam artists posing as debt collectors. It may be hard to tell the difference between a legitimate debt collector and a fake one. Sometimes a fake collector may even have some of your personal information, like a bank account number. A caller may be a fake debt collector if he:

•is seeking payment on a debt for a loan you do not recognize;

•refuses to give you a mailing address or phone number;

•asks you for personal financial or sensitive information; or

•exerts high pressure to try to scare you into paying, such as threatening to have you arrested or to report you to a law enforcement agency.

If you think that a caller may be a fake debt collector:

•Ask the caller for his name, company, street address, and telephone number. Tell the caller that you refuse to discuss any debt until you get a written ""validation notice."" The notice must include the amount of the debt, the name of the creditor you owe, and your rights under the federal Fair Debt Collection Practices Act.

If a caller refuses to give you all of this information, do not pay! Paying a fake debt collector will not always make them go away. They may make up another debt to try to get more money from you.

•Stop speaking with the caller. If you have the caller's address, send a letter demanding that the caller stop contacting you, and keep a copy for your files. By law, real debt collectors must stop calling you if you ask them to in writing.

•Do not give the caller personal financial or other sensitive information. Never give out or confirm personal financial or other sensitive information like your bank account, credit card, or Social Security number unless you know whom you're dealing with. Scam artists, like fake debt collectors, can use your information to commit identity theft – charging your existing credit cards, opening new credit card, checking, or savings accounts, writing fraudulent checks, or taking out loans in your name.

•Contact your creditor. If the debt is legitimate – but you think the collector may not be – contact your creditor about the calls. Share the information you have about the suspicious calls and find out who, if anyone, the creditor has authorized to collect the debt.

•Report the call. Contact the FTC and your state Attorney General's office with information about suspicious callers. Many states have their own debt collection laws in addition to the federal FDCPA. Your Attorney General's office can help you determine your rights under your state's law.",LPT: Make sure those Debt Collectors are real!,LifeProTips,False,1,1,1.0

How the rich avoid taxes is they basically take loans from banks on the basis of their assets like house, stocks, gold etc. They don’t sell any of these assets to generate cash flow because selling any of these will come with tax implication. So they keep these invested as it is and take out loans on them to run their life. No tax to be paid on loans and they get huge tax exemptions as well. This is what everyone should be doing, not only the financially literate. 

If you have a house that is paid up for, you should definitely take out a loan on it and invest the cash in stocks or business etc. Don’t leave an asset idle without making money out of it. And the assets like stocks, house or Gold appreciate in value so most of the times the interest you need to pay to the bank is more than offset by your asset appreciation itself. Don’t be in a hurry to re-pay the bank. The game is to pull out as much money from banks that can be given to you and use that effectively more than the interest of the banks. 

Of course most important is the loan you take should not be used to buy stupid things that depreciate like a car or fancy phones or watches etc. You can afford this to an extent but your asset needs to appreciate even more in that case to compensate for these expenditures. 

For people in the US if your student loan has the highest interest rate than bank loan rates then of course this is not applicable to you since best use of any additional cash flow for you guys will be to pay off the highest interest loan like the student loan you may have.",LPT: Learn to utilise Debt effectively to make money and avoid taxes.

You will always encounter someone who will offend you whether on purpose or by accident, and you have to learn self control and discipline.

Likewise, you don't need to feel responsible if something you say or do unintentionally makes someone else feel bad or offended. Key word is unintentional.

Basically, the majority of jobs that are out there are not a good fit for you, and the majority of the ones that are sort of in your area aren't that good or are hard to get into due to promotions getting positions with tons of applicants and such. 

So, basically 10-20% of the jobs that look like you'd like are going to be actually good fits. Most of the other ones are kind of a waste of time.

Basically, that best match the following criteria:

* Few applicants.
* Does the job sound enjoyable?
* Is the pay decent or likely decent?
* Does the company do something you'd want to do?
* Could you talk more comfortably about the job/relate experiences naturally in an interview?

I've applied for very few jobs in my life and I have had several at this point, and this is the method I use.

I hope this helps you as well as employers, because someone who applies for jobs that are well suited for them will also be better employees. It's win-win to be a good fit - your employer makes more money off of you, and your performance is naturally better. You're also more likely to get the jobs you apply to by doing this.

This isn't the only technique, but it's perhaps the most important to being able to actually more easily write a cover letter.

Here's a project plan for finding a job as a bonus:

1. Spend a couple days just getting your resume in shape. Sleep on it, do it again. Make sure it's clear and descriptive and actually showcases your abilities and anecdotes.
2. Save 30-50 jobs on a job site like LinkedIn or Indeed. This might take an hour to find 30 that are decent.
3. Pick the top few out of that 30-50.
4. Write a cover letter for the top job out of those few. This might take a little while as well to get the first cover letter in good shape. Subsequent ones will be much easier.
5. Save that cover letter as a template for future cover letters.
6. Apply for that top job with the catered cover letter and resume.
7. Use the catered resume and cover letter as templates for the next one.",LPT: apply for the top few out of 30-50 saved job applications.,LifeProTips,False,1,1,1.0

As a someone that has reviewed hundreds of resumes and hired or rejected a lot, I would like to share the tips from a hiring manager pov. One of the most important thing that surprises me is the lack of candidates understanding of their own resume. 
 
Understand YOUR Resume

Your resume represents YOU and answers some of the questions before you show up for an interview but not all. Resume preparation is of utmost importance at all time.
Who      :  It tells me your name along with any contact details.
What     :  It tells me what your role was and the responsibilities that came with it.
When    :  It tells me the time period of your previous jobs. Your total job experience or if you are entry level
Where :  It tells me where you worked prior to this interview.
 
WHY and HOW are the two things that the resume WILL NOT answer and THAT’S what the interview will be for. 
 
Understand YOUR Interview

While I know what you did, I do not know why you did it or how you did it. 
 
The WHY tells me your passion for the profession.  There is nothing wrong in exploring multiple career choices before you settle for the one you love or pays the most. Ideally your passion should pay the most.  But lets be realistic. So how adaptable are you? The energy you show in your answers to the interview question, tells me how passionate you are.  This one is a hit or miss.  Some candidates are quiet in their way but extremely passionate and it doesn’t show in the interview.  They end up doing a great job. Some candidates jump up and down in the interview but become grumpy after hiring them.  But please understand that energy levels are important in an interview.  Hiring managers take time of their work to sit in a conference room to talk to people they have only met through a resume.  There was a reason your resume got picked up.  You interview should match your resume or exceed it to be memorable among the many candidates. Keep in mind that in all the time it takes to find the candidate, the position continues to be empty and the work is done by others that might not be qualified to do.  
 
The HOW tells me if you are a team player.  Someone that engages others in getting a task done or is a solo act.  Nothing wrong with either.  Depends on how you present it. The HOW also answers me your threshold for risk taking and your understanding of the best use of time and resources. I will be looking to understand you more as a person and your learning curve.  Do you need a lot of hand holding or can you hit the road running.

Conclusion 
 
This tip is a tip of the iceberg.  There is a lot more to this so doing appropriate research helps quite a bit. There are also people far more qualified that can give even better suggestions. So take help if needed. 
 
I wish you all the success and hope this helped in a little way.
 
TLDR;   Treat your resume as an extension of YOU.  It answers some questions but not all. Make sure you put in the effort to understand your resume thoroughly. Attend interview confidently.

lksstsjp,t2_3w8zdg8b,1650786279,"1. Choose the _minimum_ amount of material that will get you the grade you need. This is the most important step. It requires doing a fair amount of research and speaking with advisors, mentors, and other students who have already taken the exam. Trying to do too much in an attempt to get a high grade is one of the most common reasons to fail these exams. You will get confused, overwhelmed, burned out, and most likely won’t even finish a single pass through the basic material. I’ve made this mistake before, as have many of my brilliant, successful friends. 
2. Figure out how much you can realistically accomplish in one day by actually doing it, before you set up a plan. If you don’t live up to your expectations, rather than being angry at yourself for “not working hard enough” and promising to yourself that you will work harder tomorrow, either adjust the resources you use or schedule the exam for later to give yourself more time. 
3. If you can’t study for 6 hours straight, read 50 pages of thick material in one go, etc, then break the day into multiple study sessions. For example: study for 2 hours from 6-8am, then go to the gym and watch a netflix show, then study from 12-2pm, then take a nap or go out with a friend, then study from 6-8pm. Or use your work to give you the break (this is what I did. I studied for a bit before work, then on my lunch break, then when I got home).
4. In your study schedule, give yourself an extra day every week for the unexpected- a headache, family emergency, the need for just a day off, etc.
5. As you go along in your studying, mark the hard to remember stuff and make flash cards/whatever works for you (ideally some active form of learning). Re-review this a few days before your exam (not the night before).

This way, you end up with a successful and realistic strategy to get the grade you need. You will not stress about whether you are doing the right thing, you will not feel overwhelmed, you will not burn out, you will feel a lot happier through this process, and you will not fall behind.",LPT: Study strategy that minimizes stress and maximizes success for exams that cover massive amounts of material- from a professional tutor and a medical school graduate whipped with well over a decade of never-ending exams,LifeProTips,False,1,1,1.0

There is nothing more uncomfortable than trying to help someone in this situation, maybe you felt bad and were trying to make them feel better, only to have them go into an outburst of frustration.  It makes you feel like your effort was a waste, or that maybe you just weren't good enough to give them the help they needed.

whenyesterdaywemet,t2_iy0cq,1650758566,"I preface this by saying everyone's grief is unique, and not all advice fits for every situation. That said, one of the biggest and most common mistakes I see when it comes to loss is denying the loss and the grief that comes with it.

What is grief? Grief is the intense physical and emotional response we experience when we lose something important. We most commonly think of grief as happening when we lose someone to death, but grief is common in many other situations. You will need to grieve when you fail at a dream, when someone you trust lets you down, when your understanding of the world is flawed, when a friend becomes unavailable, or there is a negative change in your life you cannot control. Sometimes, when I get very happy, I cry because I am grieving the fact I have not experienced that kind of happiness in a long time. Grief is weird. But it is a part of the human experience. 

We cannot control grief. Grief is a natural biological reaction to a dramatic change in our life. We cannot control our biology, rather, we evolved grief as a survival mechanism. Yes, grief actually helps us to thrive. When we deny our grief, it has numerous negative effects. It makes us miserable. It makes us angry at the world. It separates us from reality, and from connecting with our friends and family. It forces you to continue looking at the world from an old point of view, a framework which doesn't hold anymore given new evidence. When we deny our grief, we stay stuck in the past, not truly engaging in reality, but instead engaging with an old framework our subconscious knows is flawed. Instead of letting go and finding a new path forward, if we deny grief, we get angry at the world for not fitting our flawed framework. It's an unwinnable position, as the world will continue to disappoint us. 

Grief must be allowed space. If it is telling you to be sad, set aside time to cry. If it is telling you to be angry, find a pillow to shout into and a mattress to hit. When you engage your grief, saying everything that comes to mind without judgement. It doesn't matter if it makes sense. It doesn't matter if it is fair. Just get the poison of that old broken framework out. Seek out the company of loved ones. Talk about your grief with them. Get as much physical touch, like hugs, and arms around your shoulder, as you can. Grief may never completely leave you, but if you make space for it, it will leave you for a period and give you the space to move on. When we grieve, we recognize parts of the grief we no longer need to carry with us, and it gets lighter. Likewise, when we openly engage our emotions, we get stronger and more comfortable engaging them in the future. And the more we share with others, the less we have to carry on our own. 

**TL;DR** If you have experienced loss, you should try to take time to grieve. It doesn't have to be immediately after the loss. Sometimes we must continue to fight until we reach a safe place. But when we get to a safe place, and when those feelings start to well up, don't push them down. Allow yourself to ugly cry, allow yourself to yell into a pillow, and allow yourself to say everything you need to say to process, and give yourself space to grow and change.","LPT: Grief will follow you and weigh you down until you acknowledge it.

(personal summary of book „atomic habits“. I recommend reading it)



# Step 0: Make it simple

Clearly define the habit you’re trying to form. Define it so precisely that a computer could start and end the habit. For example: Don’t plan to read every day. Plan to read every day at exactly 22:00 for exactly 15 minutes. Use a timer to always stop after 15 minutes.

If you notice that you missed your habit sometimes, don’t write it off as that you simply missed it. Adjust your habit routine so that you don’t need to do it at times you can’t / don‘t want to do it. This helps because you never miss a habit with this procedure and it tells yourself that you execute your habits seriously.

Don’t waste too much time planning a habit though. *“Standardize before you optimize. You can’t improve a habit that doesn’t exist.”*


# Step 1: Make it obvious

Use the first part of the habit loop “cue, craving, response, reward”

Create one or more cues for you to remember to execute your habit. “The most persistent behaviors usually have multiple cues”

### Examples:

- Create a reminder on your phone
- Make utensils for your habits visible and put them in the way of other things
- Link your habits to other habits you already have (habit stacking)
- Talk with others about your habit, this gives you social pressure to keep your habit going
- Prepare part of your habit beforehand


# Step 2: Make it attractive

For the second part of the habit loop to work, you need to make a habit attractive. This means that you look forward to doing it.

This can be achieved as follows:

### **Mix your habit with something you want to do.**

A television show encouraged their viewers to eat popcorn and drink wine white watching the show. This made them associate the show with something positive.

Be careful while implementing something similar yourself. The action may be conflicting with the identity you try to create with the habit. (Like eating ice cream after training)

**Examples from the book:**

1. After I get my morning coffee, I will say one thing I’m grateful for that happened yesterday (need).
2. After I say one thing I’m grateful for, I will read the news (want).
3. After I pull out my phone, I will do ten burpees (need).
4. After I do ten burpees, I will check Facebook (want).

(note: wtf is a burpee?)

### Assume a new identity and join a club

*“You are a reader. You are a musician. You are an athlete. When you join a book club or a band or a cycling group, your identity becomes linked to those around you. Growth and change is no longer an individual pursuit. We are readers. We are musicians. We are cyclists. The shared identity begins to reinforce your personal identity. This is why remaining part of a group after achieving a goal is crucial to maintaining your habits. It’s friendship and community that embed a new identity and help behaviors last over the long run.”* 


# Step 3: Make it easy

The best way to build a habit is repetition and the best way to learn is to practice, not to plan. Habits will get easier and will require less brain power the more you do it. The number of repetitions are more important than the length of one repetition for automation.

## Remove points of friction

One way of making a habit easier is to lighten the cognitive load. You can do this with priming your environment. That means making preparations and removing obstacles beforehand.

Create an environment where doing the right thing is the easier choice.


## Ritualize the beginning of a process

When trying to form a new habit but facing difficulties to keep your routine, try the two minutes rule:

Plan your habits so that they only take two minutes and make your habit very easy to start.

*“As you master the art of showing up, the first two minutes simply become a ritual at the beginning of a larger routine. This is not merely a hack to make habits easier but actually the ideal way to master a difficult skill. The more you ritualize the beginning of a process, the more likely it becomes that you can slip into the state of deep focus that is required to do great things. By doing the same warm-up before every workout, you make it easier to get into a state of peak performance”*

## Preparing one-time actions

*“Onetime choices—like buying a better mattress or enrolling in an automatic savings plan—are single actions that automate your future habits and deliver increasing returns over time.”*


# Step 4: make it satisfying

*”What is rewarded is repeated. What is punished is avoided”*

## Track your progress

Seeing your progress is immensely satisfying and makes you not want to quit. Visual forms of measurement are some of the best ways to show progress. Some examples for tracking progress:

- Habit Tracker
- Making an X on a calendar for every completed set of a habit
- Seeing the page number go up after reading

## Never miss twice

It’s okay to miss your habit one time, no one’s perfect. It is however every important to take the habit back up as fast as possible. For that the rule „never miss twice“ is beneficial.

## Stop when satisfying

Don’t put in more work and time in a habit than you plan. Preferably stop before your fully satisfied. “The best way is to always stop when you are going good”


# How to break a habit

1. Make it invisible
    1. Put your phone outside your room when going to bed
    2. Hide things associated with a habit
2. Make it unattractive
    1. Highlight the problems / benefits from avoiding the habits
    2. Associate your habit with something negative
3. Make it difficult
    1. Increase the steps needed for a habit to start
        1. Take out batteries out of tv remote 
    2. Create a commitment device, restrict your choices to the favorable ones 
4. Make it unsatisfying
    1. Ask someone to watch your behavior
    2. Create a habit contract, make your bad habits public and painful.

Shuggah_Daddy,t2_ag5w5f70,1650740054,"# INTRODUCTION:

I just thought of this idea out of the blue and thought maybe I can share it here. It's regarding how to make waking up on time easy.

# SET-UP, THE WORKINGS OF THIS HACK:

Set your alarm the night before, and keep a water bottle next to the phone (not on your bed stand or whatever) and for the alarm text display write ""DRINK WATER NOW!"" or basically something that prompts your direction towards the bottle. Upon waking up, you should hopefully switch off the alarm and drink a decent amount of water.

Assuming you follow these basic (and easy) steps, two things will happen:

1. **Either**, you drink the water, but sleep afterwards.... (no problems) the water will soon wake you up as your urge to pee increases, thereby acting as a ""natural alarm"" if you will. In this case you're still waking up relatively on time.
2. **Or**, you drink the water, and in the process your body wakes up, as the water acts as a natural source to make you feel refreshed.

Either way, this simple DIY hack can help build the habit of waking up on time. Also, **bonus tip:** start with an easy target, if you have been waking up at 10AM, then perhaps start this water routine with say, 9:15AM or 9:30AM.... plus, this whole life hack is a double edged sword, as drinking water right out of bed is itself considered a very good habit.

# CONCLUSION

To be very honest with all of you, tonight will be the first night I'll try this myself. Today in the afternoon I was studying for my micro-econs exam, and this thought just randomly came to my mind  So, let's see how it goes haha

wiffleyourwaffle,t2_bk8ahmts,1650723046,"This is a hill I will die on. Heat your pizza up in the microwave until the cheese becomes melted and bread becomes soft (about 30-60 seconds per slice). The grease will usually make the bread slightly soggy, which is what you want to happen. Separately, heat up a pan on high heat until hot and place the microwaved pizza in the pan for about 30-60 seconds until the crust becomes stiff/slightly crispy. The grease helps this process, so no need to add anything on the surface of the pan. Use a spatula to remove the pizza from the pan. If it’s a high quality pizza it will taste exactly the same as when it was first made. If it’s a low quality pizza it will taste better than when it was first made. 

If you leave the slice in the pan for too long you’ll harden the bread, dry out the sauce, burn the cheese and ruin your experience. Be sure to move the pan around the stove top burner because the center of the pan will have the most heat and you want to make the bread and crust of the pizza cook evenly and achieve equal crispiness.",LPT: The best way to reheat cold pizza is with a microwave and a stove top.

Shuggah_Daddy,t2_ag5w5f70,1650722748,"# INTRODUCTION:

It is natural to feel anxious, angry, sad, etc. on certain things or past events. Over thinking about a certain negative event that makes you bothered can lead to an overall reduction in productivity and generally just ruins your entire day. But **there is a solution** to this in my opinion.

# WHAT TO DO:

1. Take out a sheet of paper and pen (no, don't use your electronic devices, just plain and simple paper would do)
2. Write down your emotions, the storyline, a background of the event, or literally whatever comes to your mind. In other words, have a full fledged ranting session out for the paper, and don't leave any details out. 
3. After writing, just read the whole thing in your mind.... I would recommend you read it just once and fully. 
4. After reading, just tear the paper into tiny pieces and throw it away.

# LEARNING:

In my personal opinion, my overall mood improves a lot after this exercise and my focus on my work improves. Your mind needs an opening to rant it out, and a paper and pen are the most patient friends to rant to. Throwing and tearing the paper afterwards is a symbol of 'moving on'. 

# CONCLUSION

Spending 10 mins on this method is much better than ruining 10 hours. Maybe give it a try and see what happens. For me, this was a game changer. 

Lastly, if you use Brave Rewards, and you liked this post, it would mean a lot to me if you leave a tip for me as well :)","LPT: Here's a good way to control your negative emotions: I call this method the 'write, tear, and throw', read below:",LifeProTips,False,1,1,1.0

I told my dad that I asked my boss for a raise, and when I got an answer I wasn’t stoked on, I asked his boss.

I feel a once a year raise (even if it’s just a buck) should be standard.

I got a substantial raise today and it’s because I asked my bosses about how much I was making and let them know I believe I deserve more. My wife and Antiwork both gave me the courage to do so.

Worst case scenario they say no, or not right now we’ll see how things look later. But asking the questions and letting them know you’re serious can’t hurt.
