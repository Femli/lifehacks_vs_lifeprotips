YouAreAGoodDogDug,t2_keydf0zo,1648702382.0,"There are several reasons why a bed could require changing during the night ‚Ä¶and it‚Äôs extra hard to do when you‚Äôve been yanked out of Dreamland.   There‚Äôs something you can do to make changing those sheets easy, no matter what the time!  Make the bed in layers that can be taken off to reveal clean sheets.  Here‚Äôs how:  Put a waterproof mattress pad down, make the bed as usual with sheets.  Add another waterproof mattress pad or waterproof pads and add another set off sheets.  When there‚Äôs a late night accident, you will simply remove the wet sheets and waterproof mattress pad and voila!  A clean, made bed, ready for using.  

If you want to make the bed, so that multiple accidents can happen without changing the sheets, consider buying one size larger sheet sets for the upper layers.  This will accommodate the extra size of the multiple sheet sets underneath them.  

For kids who provide wet spots consistently in the same place, consider using a draw sheet with doggy pee pads (unscented) underneath.  Place a doggy pee pad where the spot is expected then take a top sheet and fold it in half, lengthwise.  Put the folded sheet over the pee pad and tuck the sides in on both sides of the bed, so that the sheet is snug, keeping the pee pad in place.  Scotch tape can also be used to keep pads in place.",Changing Sheets at ‚ÄúWee‚Äù Hours of the Morning?,lifehacks,False,0.0,1.0,1.0

If you ever accidentally burn your finger(s) &amp;/or hand, grab yourself any type of rubber glove (improvise with cling wrap, etc. if need be), put the glove on your hand that's suffering from the burns, and get plain yellow mustard (if you don't have yellow mustard, ketchup can also work as a substitute) and squirt an excessive amount all on the inside of the glove to where it's saturated. Keep the glove on for upwards of an hour, and once you take it off, I can 100% guarantee that you will have no pain, no residual scarring, &amp; will be thanking me later.

A couple months back, my mom was over at my place, and I don't quite remember what she was doing, but some type of chemical liquid got too hot, and it poured out &amp; onto her fingers. She was in pain for around 20 minutes, trying everything from aloe vera, to ice, to cold water to sooth the burn, especially since the burn was starting to bubble up. After I realized nothing was working and she was thinking about maybe having to go to the ER, I remembered this hack I learned many years ago - needless to say, it literally saved her finger, stopped the pain, and prevented her finger(s) from being possibly disfigured &amp;/or scarred, &amp; from enduring 2nd/3rd degree burns.  My Mom likes to remind me often how if it wasn't for me and my mustard in a glove trick, that her finger would be f*ck#! off!

SrtDior,t2_b3th857f,1647942889.0,"I‚Äôm making this post because I want to hold myself accountable

I‚Äôm 23 years old currently working as a bouncer. I‚Äôve spent so much time working and I barely have anything to show for it. My life right now is literally smoking hella weed, gambling, partying taking girls on dates for drinks and occasionally some drugs.

It‚Äôs a fast lifestyle and sounds like a good time for anybody my age group but I couldn‚Äôt feel any emptier.

Yesterday I went out with a couple I met at my job and I took a girl on a date with me. The night consisted of throwing money at strippers at a huge strip club, drinking as much as we wanted too cuz  we got free bottles, the couple also brought some cocaine and MDMA so we indulged in a bit of that too.  And of course sex with this girl on hella drugs after 

Sounds like a good time right?
Wrong 
My mind felt like it was in a very dark place and I felt my vibration was super low something didn‚Äôt feel right at all.

I remember just driving home with my head hanging low and just feeling super defeated for some reason.

I think the reason is I know the potential I have for myself I‚Äôve been able to accomplish a lot and have really good jobs 

My problems all come with discipline, I have no balance when it comes to doing things. 
I‚Äôll get as high as I possibly can, I‚Äôll gamble all the money to my name, I‚Äôll not show up to jobs just because my mind feels a bit wrong

I‚Äôm done living like this I‚Äôm cutting out the small minded people out of my life and I‚Äôm getting selfish about investing in myself as much as I can in any way possible.

I come from the warmest sweetest parents you could ever meet. They raised me with such great morals, they represent hard work respect and loyalty.

My parents are getting older every single day they still both work Monday-Friday and im here barely working 3 days in the week. What the f*** kind of selfish bs is that. 

I see many people in my age group living like this and thinking it‚Äôs perfectly ok. That could never be f****ng me. God put me in this earth for a greater purpose than to just be self depleting myself all day and he blessed me with many great traits.

I have no excuses whatsoever. I‚Äôve had the pretty girls, I‚Äôve droven the dope cars, I‚Äôve met hella celebrities, I‚Äôve been to the best parties Miami has to offer.
Nothing makes me feel emptier every time than these temporary pleasures.

Real happiness to me is getting a workout, making myself a healthy meal, reading books, going out to the beach catching sunlight, accomplishing task that I know are gonna help me have a better tomorrow. Things like that have always made me not excited but fulfilled. True genuine happiness not dopamine from drugs

If your still reading anybody have some advice for me maybe? Regardless I‚Äôm making this change no matter what I‚Äôm tired of the lifestyle I‚Äôve been leading when I know the lifestyle I‚Äôm able to achieve.

Alexdandanalex,t2_1n8bzqoq,1647889643.0,"Hello, all! 

Almost all the music I've listened to since my adolescence were through sub-$10 checkout isle headphones. The main problems these headphones suffer from is cheap construction (tons of resonant space in the earphone itself/shotty connections) and excessive midrange (specifically the 500hz band).

Open the eq app on your phone/streaming platform and eq out the 500hz band by -15(ish)dB, and the 250hz and 1000hz bands by a quarter of that amount. Play around with the EQ to dial in the sound. I recommend using the aux in your car for reference. Switch between your headphones and the stereo and try to match the sound of the stereo EQ'd flat (all parameters at zero) to the sound of the headphones. 

This isn't going to make them sound like Sennheisers, but 5 minutes careful EQing can make a $5.00 pair of headphones sound like a $30.00 pair. When I was on a shoestring budget, that difference made my day a little nicer :). I've also heard of people stuffing the headphone cavity (the area behind the speakers) with cotton to nix most of the resonance. 

Hope this helps in a tiny way!",Simple way to considerably improve the sound quality of cheap headphones:,lifehacks,False,0.0,1.0,1.0

However, I hate the smell of bleach, and it usually takes a couple washes to get the bleach smell out. Usually I‚Äôll just rewash them on a speed cycle them with some vinegar afterwards to neutralize the smell. 

My water bill has been kind of high this month though, so I‚Äôm wondering if it‚Äôd be safe to wash them with bleach, but add vinegar to the fabric softener dispenser all in one wash. Obviously I know that bleach and vinegar can create toxic fumes, but the fabric softener gets released on the rinse cycle, so will it still create toxic fumes if I do that? 

It‚Äôs not like the bleach and the vinegar are gonna get directly mixed together because the bleach will get released during the wash cycle and the vinegar will get released during the rinse cycle.

closet_cheater,t2_769akocj,1647651807.0,"Hello r/lifehacks!

Being both completely sick of the shitty oligopolistic streaming sites ( @ Netflix &amp; Hulo ) and left with a few free hours without studying on hand, I developed [**Oligopoly**](https://olgply.com). Thought I'd share it with you wonderful humans in hopes that it'll help you guys out as much as it helped out a few friends of mine.

[Oligopoly (olgply.com)](https://olgply.com) is one of THOUSANDS of free streaming sites that has been infiltrating reddit lately. Contrary to other services, however, oligopoly attempted to reach a few goals others have yet to set.

These goals include but are not limited to:

* PWA ( progress web app ) functionality
   * able to install app on mobile device
* Modern user-interface
* Limited to AT MOST one ad per stream
   * funding comes out of own pocket
* Automatically update movies from [TMBD ( The Movie Database )](https://www.themoviedb.org/?language=en-US)
* Scrape streams from multiple sources.
* Completely Open-Sourced

Hopefully this project could satisfy at least a few people looking for something relatively refreshing. Tried my best to stray away from the copy and paste, heavily-monetized streaming sites you see already flooding the internet. Feel free to let me know how well I did with that.

&gt;**How is this possibly legal?**  
&gt;  
&gt;In the United States and EU member countries such as Germany and France, national copyright   
law prohibits the sale and uploading of unlicensed content. Thankfully, in our case, this content   
is not uploaded by us. Instead, third-party CDNs host and upload the content for us. My site   
automatically scrapes the internet for these out-of-jurisdiction networks and directly links to   
them on our site. As long as you refrain from downloading or torrenting media off our site, the   
only one the government has to blame is those naughty naughty third party CDNs.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**Should I be worried about my ISP?**  
&gt;  
&gt;You're streaming content, not seeding it. They could care less haha.

JetSetRadioFuture,t2_5x35z,1647275196.0,"I had frequent mold issues, since I don't go through cheese *all* that fast. 

All I changed was that I don't reach inside cheese packages or touch cheese I'm not going to eat.

Details:

\-Shredded cheese: Open and pour, never reach inside. Use clean spoon if pour is a no-go.

\-Block cheese: I wear gloves, or use a paper towel to touch the cheese block as I'm handling it. 

\-Sliced cheese: trickier, but can be done: bend the stack like a deck of cards to loosen desired # of slices. Then either use fork to extract, or fingers if you think you can do it w/o touching inside of plastic packaging. 

Since I changed my ways, I haven't had mold on cheese ever. It seems to dry out before it molds.   
(Your mileage may vary due to the types of mold spores in your air, which varies locally.)

&amp;#x200B;

I don't go through cheese super fast

Decided to try 'sterile' protocols to see what happened. 

No mold since then, amazingly.

Details: 

Do Not:

Touch cheese  
Reach inside cheese packaging  
Touch the inside of packaging surfaces

...that's it. Use forks or spoons to get at cheese if necessary.

jj4th,t2_g90o2,1647223865.0,"I see a lot of people saying they can't/won't use food delivery services because it's too expensive.  As a frequently flyer on food delivery apps I thought I could share a method I use to make it actually reasonable, time saving, and even healthy as well.  I'm not sure if my method will work for everyone (I'm single and live in a big city with a low cost of living and a lot of food choices), but perhaps there is someone out there who can benefit from my experience.

Long before COVID I used to work at home, with some pretty crazy hours that made it difficult for me to find the time to make meals beyond warming something in the microwave.  As the good book says, ""Man shall not live by frozen dinners alone,"" so when food delivery services became a thing I was interested.  At first it seemed too expensive, and potentially unhealthy... but I've figured out over time how to make it work, lose weight, save time, all without going broke.

If you find yourself without the time to make meals and your bank account is starting to whine in protest, perhaps something here will help.

I put this first because it's probably the biggest money saver overall.  Even if you just buy drinks at the grocery store (I'm a water drinker so I don't even do that), you will save SO MUCH MONEY not ordering drinks.  You're at home, no reason to order the expensive, marked up restaurant drink.

**Step 2: Leftovers/Split portions and Buy in Bulk**

If you're ordering a single meal for $10 with a $4 delivery and $6 tip that's $20 for one meal.  This is BAD.  Also that meal is probably 1100-1200 calories.  How I keep it reasonably healthy and save money overall is by ordering two meals, and then splitting them in half.  The delivery and tip usually don't change (or only by a dollar) for ordering more food.  $30 for four meals is MUCH better and more reasonable.

**Step 3: Lunch combos**

This is a small hack that can really push this method over the edge.  4 meals for $30 sound good?  Well if you can find a few restaurants that give reasonably sized lunch combos (chinese food and mexican food are great for this, but I also have an italian place near me that does the same thing) all of a sudden your 4 meals are costing $25, or less!  At this point it's often costing me less than fixing the same meal at home for myself.  Plus it gives you a natural split for more variety.  Have the enchiladas for lunch and the taco, rice and beans for dinner, etc...

**Step 4: Try different apps/Coupon clip**

Not all food delivery services charge the same for the same restaurant.  Obviously you're going to get the most bang for your buck if you can manage to stick to one service and leverage their monthly plan (heresy, I know, but it works out, I'll show the math at the end).  But often it's worth shopping other apps for one-time discounts, come-back coupons, etc... and just cheaper prices.

**Step 5: Shop close restaurants/Pickup when you can**

The delivery fees and suggested tips tend to be lower on closer trips.  To tie in to the above, a lot of these apps will even offer credit for placing a pickup order every once in a while and driving there yourself.  A $5 credit for pickup and not paying delivery/tip means the food cost less than if you had eaten at the restaurant.

Combining all these steps I've managed to average about $7.00 a meal for lunch and dinner (I usually just have a protein shake for breakfast and a banana or some strawberries).  When I was cooking all my own meals, it cost me about $6 a meal on average and I didn't have nearly the variety of food to choose from.

**TLDR:** I manage to pay about $7.00 a meal on average with food delivery by ordering multiple meals at once, splitting portions in half, buying lunch combos, nixxing the beverages, ordering from close restaraunts with low delivery fees, and coupon clipping.  This is about the same as when I was cooking for myself.",How to be financially responsible and still get your food delivered.,lifehacks,False,0.0,1.0,1.0

If you have travelled somewhere with just carry-on luggage and need to bring back more items than you brought but don‚Äôt want to buy an expensive suitcase (especially if you have one at home, you can use a [27-gallon tote](https://imgur.com/a/5k1WPk5) as your checked luggage. 

The dimensions of the tote is within the specs of most airlines. 

Additional tip; zip tie two or more of the holes and leave some zip ties on the inside on top of your items so TSA can re zip tie it

I do this all the time. My parents live in another city and I stay for months at a time and my luggage is inconsistent sometimes I bring them down tons of stuff. Sometimes the opposite so totes have become normal to me. They are more awkward to carry but they accommodate some items that a suitcase won‚Äôt. 

They really win when you don‚Äôt want to bring an empty suitcase down.

jbtuckr,t2_3wpjz70z,1646567925.0,"I work for a cell phone repair shop, I‚Äôve worked at numerous throughout the years. A lot of places use the cheapest parts they can get, even if it‚Äôs from a reputable supplier, so here‚Äôs my advice on the best way to get your phone/tablet fixed with the best quality. 

Apple doesn‚Äôt sell its parts to consumers, so third party manufacturers make their own parts or refurbish previously broken ones. Newer phones use OLED panels which are superior in every way to LCD (quality, efficiency, thinness, etc). There are LCD aftermarket options out now for iPhones, but they don‚Äôt look as good, they MURDER your battery, and they don‚Äôt exactly fit the phone perfectly since they‚Äôre thicker height wise. Most 3rd party places use LCD instead of oled for iPhone repairs, I‚Äôve worked for a place before that charged the premium and ensured people it was OLED but it was LCD, and it felt like a sin for every repair I had to do. 
What to do: get an account with MonileSentrix (the biggest wholesaler), or Injured Gadgets (a few dollars more than MS, but have had less defective screens sent to us than MS recently). Just make up a fake business name and put your home address, no business ever checks if you‚Äôre legit. Then just buy your own part and bring it in. Every place I‚Äôve worked at charges $35 if someone brings in their own part but doesn‚Äôt offer a warranty (if it‚Äôs defective, you just exchange it yourself). We charge $60-100 for labor on repairs where we use our own parts, lots of places charge higher for newer phones. 

The plus is you get to ensure your part is the quality you want, and the labor cost is cheaper. An added bonus is you get access to discounted cool ass accessories the sites offer, and a bonus is depending on the phone, you can get a battery with higher mAh than factory since battery technology is constantly improving

Also to note, injured gadgets has something called InsiredGadgets liquid glass which is basically a $300 repair warranty you can get for the wholesale price of $25. I don‚Äôt use a case bc I use it and I‚Äôve cracked and gotten reimbursed for 4+ devices. Totally worth it. You can order literally any part imaginable for your device, with the OEM options being more expensive, but always better. 3rd party repair shops are great, but it‚Äôs a business and they cut corners to make the most money. Not necessarily a bad thing unless they‚Äôre not upfront about it. Only thing you can‚Äôt replace yourself is the back glass, it requires a couple-thousand dollar machine and the only place to find glass with the apple logo on it is in obscure areas since it‚Äôs a trademarked logo.",Phone tablet repair: how to get premium quality at 3rd party shops,lifehacks,False,0.0,1.0,1.0

THEN We needed a power switch. There was already an electrical outlet under the sink for the dishwasher, but code says the dishwasher needed a dedicated line and the disposal needs a dedicated line.

That means going up into the attic, running new lines from the fusebox to the outlet that's already there, and connecting the dishwasher and disposal properly.

Electrician quoted me another $1,000 for that.

Now, I know it's not to code... but for $16 on Amazon, I have a working garbage disposal. ;)

SPon23567,t2_3x73kndk,1645957285.0,"all right this one's a bit of a doozy. it's a funky little thing that I discovered after buying a dragon fruit from the grocery store. apparently dragon fruit have this weird quality that allows them to absorb odor, something that I wasn't aware of until I bought one and put it right smack dab in the center of my fridge on the top rack. 

I kid you not there hasn't been a single odor coming from my fridge anywhere since I put this thing in my refrigerator. and normally there would be all kinds of smells like fruits and meats and milk 

it's so effective that I didn't even know that I had expired and moldy fruit and things in the drawers in my fridge. this is something that I remembered hearing about back when I was really young but I forgot. you can use certain types of fruits to absorb odors.

the way to do it is you go to the grocery you buy a dragon fruit a whole dragon fruit. skin and everything. don't cut it or pierce it, and place it roughly in the center of your refrigerator on the top rack as far forward as you can. you want to be able to see it because if it does start to rot you want to throw it out obviously. and then you just kind of leave the dragon fruit in your fridge. it apparently will just absorb the odors that would normally appear in a refrigerator. to a certain extent it will basically make your refrigerator odorless. I have had mine in the fridge for about a week and a half and I haven't smelled anything in the fridge, I'm literally known as""the guy that has the nose of a dog"" even my brother can't smell anything in the refrigerator and normally by now there'd be something. but no apparently it's just smells like there's nothing in there.

&amp;#x200B;

just a bit of an interesting tip for anyone who might want a cheap way to keep the refrigerator from stinking, or if you have something that's very stinky that you want to put in your fridge if you put a dragon fruit next to it there's a chance that it could absorb a lot of the odor.",how to get rid of those annoying smells in your fridge...,lifehacks,False,0.0,1.0,1.0

Have you ever felt a pain that is annoying and you would like to be gone? Hit your toe on the table? Got something in your eye that causes it to hurt every time you blink? A needle stuck under your finger perhaps? Fallen down and hit your dominant arm really hard? Someone said a mean word? Did someone say the N-word and now you can't physically work? Your parental figure forcefully hugged you? Girlfriend broke up perhaps? Your parents disapprove of your sexuality or your new 5th gender?

Do not worry! Because the solution is here! By following my simple and easy to follow 5 step life hack I can teach you how to effectively deal with pain!

Step 1. Have a pain that you want to be moved.

Step 2. Pick a body part where you don't feel any pain. 

Step 3. Utilize tools, hands or body part.

Step 4. Relocate pain to choose body part by applying more pain to the new location than the old location.

Step 5. Pain is now relocated to a different area and you no longer feel any pain from your original area.

But later last year i realised  i made a huge mistake and then then i tried to Convinced  her a lot to back Again. i apologised  to her everyday for a month. Her friends  knows How  much i cried. But she said she cant be back. She said she wants a relationship  less simple  life and doesn‚Äôt  feel the same about me! I said be friends then, but she she said it also not possible. She said seeing  my texts makes her sad and she  can't  focus on anything  after that i stopped  convincing  her again!

But recently  i talked to her closest friend,  whom she(my ex) share everything. Her friend told me we might  have a chance to  get  back together. When i asked her why does she think so, she said she doesn‚Äôt  know, she just felt that. My Ex's friend  said she sometimes thinks about me but then regret  it. She is actually  confused  Whether  i am the right  person or not. But she did forgive me for what i did.

But my problem  is i am thinking  about her a lot. Everytime  i see her makes me so sad. It's  been 5 months  since i broke  up, part  of me feels she Will  never  comeback ,  but i still cant overcome  her

What to do now? Am i acting as  a loser? Or is it normal! These relationship things are new to me &amp; she is my first love.  I dont  want to be in relationship  with any other girl except  herself!

logantauranga,t2_35osh,1645476079.0,"Dan Pink has done a lot of work to reduce complex ideas down to simple 1-2 minute videos, but his titles are clickbait-y and his guests invent buzzwords to sell their books. I've summarized each of these down from his videos.  

These are listed by Pinkcast video number, so to read more click this [link to the videos and source info.](https://www.danpink.com/pinkcast/)
  
1.1 When stuck, ask 'what would you tell your best friend to do?'
  
1.2 Each day, write down then do your Most Important Task before the noise of work can get in the way.
  
1.3. When stuck, use a sounding board (rubber duck) to talk through a process/problem.
  
1.4 A parent/boss should be both supportive and demanding, it's not zero-sum.
  
1.5 Dan likes a specific pencil.
  
1.6. Do a 'premortem' to anticipate pitfalls and write out positive practices that will avoid each one.
  
1.7 When deciding to do something or not: if it's not a 'hell yes' then it's a no.
  
1.8 If you can do the next step on something within 2 minutes, it's best to do it now.
  
1.9 Instead of positive affirmations, ask yourself questions to reflect on your plan.
  
1.10 If you know 'the 1%' abstract/summary, it will help you contextualise a whole body of work.
  
1.11 Instead of planning, start by doing. Prototype, volunteer, fail in a low-stakes way. Then begin your plan.
  
1.12 Starting writing down failures and what you learned. It's data to help you stop repeating mistakes.
  
1.13 Set up an hourly beep on your phone. Take a breath, reset to your top priority.
  
1.14 Use an 'empty chair' to periodically remind yourself to think of user/reader/customer needs.
  
1.15 Your life will feel more meaningful if you regularly go out of your way to do nice things for people.
  
1.16 As well as a To Do list, keep a 'To Don't' list (things to avoid) and a 'Done' list (what you completed).
  
1.17 Saying ""I don't"" is more effective than saying ""I can't"" because it describes a principle.
  
1.18 Get your staff to write the company's purpose on a card. Most will cluster. The rest will learn.
  
1.19 The person with the biggest screw-up story wins a Stuffed Monkey for that week; this changes culture.
  
1.20 Gifts (abilities) + Passions (interests) + Values (good workplace/role) = Calling (what gets you out of bed).
  
1.21 Six career tips: (1) plans fail, (2) enjoy using your strengths, (3) get ahead by focusing on the work, (4) persistence is more important than talent, (5) if you aim high, failure is OK, (6) cause meaningful change.
  
2.1 The placebo effect of 'lucky' items can actually help.
  
2.2 Take handwritten notes because it's slower and you're forced to summarise rather than transcribe.
  
2.3 Keep things in a drawer that make you feel nice like family photos/thank-you notes/etc for when you need a boost.
  
2.4 Get perspective on something upsetting by imagining you're looking back at it 1 day/week/year later.
  
2.5 Don't jump to solution-ing right away. Dwell within the problem space for a while and re-examine your initial questions.
  
2.6 Repeat of 1.18.
  
2.7 Talk less about 'how' to implement stuff, and more about 'why' you do stuff, to keep your focus and motivation.
  
2.8 Get emotional distance from jerks by pretending to be scientist who studies jerks and has found a specimen.
  
2.9 It's better to give bad news first because the good news at the end makes it seem like things are getting better.
  
2.10 Ask people what gift they want and give them that.
  
2.11 Start diets on Mondays because it feels like a fresh start. He lists 34 other days that are also good.
  
2.12 Networking is much easier if you reconnect with established contacts rather than reaching out to strangers.
  
2.13 To perform better, hyper-focus on 2-3 things and go all-in to get every little detail right.
  
2.14 Morning exercise for weight loss, mood boost, and establishing a routine. Evening exercise for enjoyment, performance, and avoiding injury.
  
2.15 Drink coffee an hour after getting up and also before/after a short nap.
  
2.16 Before giving feedback, tell people you have high expectations and believe they can meet those expectations.
  
2.17 Set 25 goals for your life. Choose the top five and ignore the other 20 until those five are achieved.
  
2.18 When you're nervous, tell yourself you're actually excited. They feel similar except one is positive.
  
2.19 After you master your job and don't feel like you're learning anything new, it's time to change roles/companies.
  
2.20 When cold-emailing, respect someone's time, have very specific questions, and keep your ask small and easy.
  
2.21 Take breaks. Go for a walk, or have social contact, or go outside. Don't do work stuff or phone stuff.
  
2.22 If you use self-talk for motivation, use your name instead of 'I'.
  
2.23 You can use Pixar's six-sentence structure to easily easily frame an idea/pitch as a story that feels compelling.
  
2.24 Dan does weird things with hotel room stuff.
  
2.25 Be very specific when you ask for help. Ask in person. Make sure it's the right person to ask.

Well, I found a method to help prevent this (it‚Äôs not 100% perfect, nor will it always apply. For example, if you‚Äôre on a crowded bus and don‚Äôt have the foot room), and I hope it helps.

Number one; don‚Äôt lock your knees, have your knees slightly bent. Not only does it make your joints hurt in the long run, but it‚Äôs more rigid, so you can‚Äôt fight against or adjust to the force of the bus‚Äôs movement. And number two, feet at shoulder width. With a wider stance, you‚Äôre able to have a more stable base. With these two steps in mind, you can adjust far more easily, adjustments being far easier due to your unlocked knees, and be far less likely to bowl over. I do this when I‚Äôm on the bus (college student), and I‚Äôm even able to stand without grabbing something, it works so well a majority of the time. That‚Äôs just me, though.

A kidney stone is a mineral deposit built up in the urinal, and there is only one way to get it out. It has to pass through the urethra. This is painful.

Labor pain is comparable to this pain.

Symptoms of kidney stones include severe pain in the side, or a burning sensation while urinating. This pain increases rapidly and then disappears immediately.

The locksmith took pity and the fact that I had to pay him every visit, I was practically helping him make a living. He actually made me write my door key# in a discreet place (split into two places) so i could get the key made for $15 instead of $100, which is what a call to him would have cost me.

Anyway I finally figured out a way to stop that from happening. My issue was that I usually have stuff in my hands, carrying things or doing things and tended to put the keys into my pockets if I was wearing pants, or purse if it was with me. If i had neither I would set it down somewhere and that would be the last I saw of it.

Reason being that it gets lonely being a single child. It's kind of made me start to consider the idea. But I feel it's kind of selfish for me to have another kid that I can't give everything that I want to.

If your ass makes noise, then thats still going to reverberate. This does not solve this issue, but merely the water issue.

Whether you drop a rock solid mega-duece 5000, or piss fire from your ass, this will make it so it doesn't make a loud sound when it hits the water.

Step 1: You unravel some toilet paper.

Step 2: You place the toilet paper inside the water and lay it flat. You may want to layer it depending on how you feel the velocity of your shit will release.

Step 3: Take your shit. IN SILENCE. No longer feel embarassed in public restrooms. You have ascended.

Danielnrg,t2_eb4za,1645244952.0,"The conventional wisdom is to spend at least 2 months of your annual salary on an engagement ring. So, if you're making $60,000 a year, your engagement ring should cost at least $10,000.

However, if you get engaged young and before you've found a good career, you can save soooo much on engagement rings. In 2019 I made $15,000 working at a movie theater. If I'd gotten engaged then, I'd only have to pay $2,500 for an engagement ring! 

The best part is, whoever you're getting engaged to will agree to get engaged as long as you spend two months worth of salary! It doesn't matter how much your salary is. If I'd gotten engaged when I was fresh out of high school and didn't have a job, she would've had to give ME money to pay for the ring!

FlowMeTheMoney,t2_721bkwnu,1645109383.0,"Disclaimer: This is not a ‚Äúhack‚Äù to freely use more data than you pay for every every single month back to back. It‚Äôs more for in case you‚Äôve used all your data and you‚Äôre stranded and you ended up using Google Maps way too much (i.e. me) or you genuinely just forget to turn it off. Also a teeny lie is involved but Canadian cell phone providers charge up the ass anyways.

Anyways, I‚Äôve been with three separate Canadian cellphone providers and prior to hitting my data cap I always get a text saying, ‚ÄúYou have reached 90% of your data usage.‚Äù 

In the case I have not turned my data off past this point, I‚Äôll get another text saying, ‚ÄúThere is $50 data overage charges on your bill‚Äù-blah blah legally can‚Äôt go over $50 etc.

All you have to do is:

1. Call your service provider.

2. Tell them, ‚ÄúI usually receive a text saying I have reached 90% data usage and I turn my data off based on the text. I didn‚Äôt receive any text this time around and my bill is way too high.‚Äù

If they say they‚Äôre going to escalate it, or investigate, just say you‚Äôve been a loyal customer and will switch providers if this is not waived. Keep in mind the service representative DOES have the authority to waive charges, so there is no need for escalation.

3. The service representative at this point will just waive the charges. One or two times of saying you will switch providers usually works - keeping old customers is cheaper than finding new ones.

I have used this personally four times with my current provider, but due to times I genuinely needed data.",How to Get Data Overage Charges Waived,lifehacks,False,4.0,1.0,1.0

1 Not stripped fairly regularly (releases trapped yuk as they're designed to trap yuk)
2 Washed with fabric softener (absorbency loss)
3 Dried with dryer sheets (absorbency loss)

Vacuum areas (around/on toilets, etc.) before cleaning with microfiber to avoid the awful fuzz &amp; hair that won't rinse out.

Color code the cloths with their use, such as orange for furniture polishing, green for kitchen,  yellow for toilets/blue for the rest of the bathroom... 

With glass, use one cloth (damp) for spraying and wiping window cleaner and another (dry) one for buffing. 

Plan on using several in the house cleaning process, they are faster, better &amp; less expensive than paper towels.

It all started when I was washing one bottle that had been stored on top of the fridge for some time. The bottle was caked in kitchen grease (I live in a very old house in LA with 3 rando roommates so we all inherited this nastiness when we moved in)

Soap and water never work on whatever this gross stuff is

I thought to try grape seed oil. Poured some in a small tray and used a brush. The grime came right off. I then washed with soap and water and voila! The glass bottle wasn‚Äôt sticky or dirty anymore. 

Ecstatic I thought, ‚Äúthis must be a thing,‚Äù and proceeded to wipe down the entire top surface of the fridge nd stove with grape seed oil, then take a soapy sponge and wipe down again.

I was surprised when I googled grapeseed oil and this wasn‚Äôt as much of a ‚Äúthing‚Äù as I thought. I ultimately used soap and water to clean so I‚Äôm pretty sure that I made the kitchen safer by removing the caked on grease, but wondering if anyone can inform from their knowledge or experience?

* The first (or last) *x* letters of the service
* The number of letters of the service
* The name of the service spelled backwards
* The digit above each letter of the service on a QWERTY keyboard (e.g. `Reddit` -&gt; `433385`)

As a completely fabricated example, you can improve the password `correct horse battery staple` (xkcd's example of a secure password) by adding a few of these.

Next time you have hiccups, grab a pencil or pen and shove in between your upper and lower teeth. So basically gently bite down on the pencil or pen.

As you're still biting down on it, grab a big glass of water (as cold as possible) and stand over a sink preferably if you can. And just chug that water down with the pencil between your teeth. It'll feel unnatural but pretend it's not there and concentrate on glugging down the water.

Keep doing it until you've finished the entire glass and I guarantee the hiccups are gone. I legit only discovered this a few weeks ago

Bonus tip but I've only tried it once tonight so it may be a fluke but I had hiccups and couldn't be bothered to get up and get water so I put my finger in between my teeth like a fake version of the above and started gasping air between my finger like a fuckin loser and the hiccups are gone lolol bye",Hiccups.,lifehacks,False,6.0,1.0,1.0

# How To Work On Yourself

### Your guide to become the best version of yourself

The best journey you'll ever experience is the journey of self improvement when you make a decision to reach your highest self and become the greatest version of you,only then you can commit to whatever it needs to be done.you just need to believe that your hard work will pay off.  


#### Here are 8 things you need to do when you're working on yourself:

### 1-Recognize your toxic traits

no one is perfect ,we all have issues and toxic traits that most of us don't even recognize because we are deeply involved in only confronting the best picture of us and hiding our worst,though,by doing this,we are suppressing our true identity and nature,thus we can never be able to be ourselves or experience life properly.  


### 2-Eliminate the barriers inside your mind

our thoughts are not the reality,we can never see reality as it is until we clean our vision by eliminating the thoughts and beliefs that keeps us away from seeing true life and moving forward.these barriers are self-made and are only meant to obstruct our sight ,so we need identify them and work on getting rid of them.  


### 3-Build trust within yourself

this only can happen when you feel safety and peace within you,trusting yourself includes listening to your inner voice and believing it,trusting your plans and believing in you when no one else¬† does.this builds a strong bond with yourself that allows you to become decisive about your next step and move more smoothly towards what you desire.  


### 4-Visualize your goals

everything imagineable or the mind can think of,can easily happen in real life,thus,you can start visualizing your goals with every little detail¬† as if they are truly happening right now.through this process,our conscious mind is convinced that your specific goals will most likely happen,at the same time,it strenghtens your beliefs about the possibility of it happening.you just need to work on it as if it's already yours.  


### 5-Leave your comfort zone

no improvement can come from staying in your comfort zone,on the contrary,our comfort zones are the primary cause of our stagnation in life,because it hinders us from taking a leap towards doing something that might completely change us and our life.our comfort zone may be an activity,a thought or a habit,and sometimes we don't even notice it,until we look closely.  


### 6-Stay curious

life is all about asking new questions everyday,and the process of looking for the answers is your lifelong journey.so make sure to open your mind to acquiring knowledge everyday from inside and outside you.curiosity is an exercice for the mind¬† that helps connecting us with limitless answers,and thus,shapes us to become exactly what we're destined to be.you should first work on answering the questions about the inner you in order to open the door for answering questions about¬† what's outside¬† you.  


### 7-Seek permanent pleasures

never put extraordinary effort on temporary life pleasure that won't benefit you in the long run,instead plan ahead and let your present actions match your plans for the future and the type of life you're seeking.  


### 8-Be responsible for your life

pick wisely your life choices because the smallest decision can push you forward or backward that's in your hands.try to seek more what benefit you in terms of improvement,learning and pleasure,and¬†make sure that the choices you make are a reflection of your ambitions and goals and what you're preparing for your future,meanwhile,avoid everything that distracts you from setting your mind on that goal.  


### Conclusion

there is only one person responsible for the quality of your life and that person is you,your true life will only begin when you start acting according to your life's purpose,so bear in mind that your life depends on you ,and there will always be work for you to do if you want to keep moving in life.

Posting photos of our wooden cabinets that have horrible looking stains on them after a cleaning service we never used before did a deep clean on our house. I wasn't home so I don't know what they used. There is now harsh white streaking that won't come off, anyone have any idea what caused these stains and what do I use to get it off? Be as specific as possible, I know nothing about cleaning wood (which is why I hired a service).
*NOTE: I already tried a damp (not wet) rag with mild dish soap on one area and it did absolutely nothing to the streaks. Does this mean they are actually scratches/discoloration ingrained in the wood as opposed to residue sitting on top?

Step 1: Press ctrl+shift+i to enter inspect element mode

Step 2: Click the box at the top left corner of the inspect element box, then click the nickname element

Step 3: You should see a bit of text highlighted in the element tab now. Find the thing that says 'maxlength' and change the value from 15 to any large number you want

Step 4: Go back to the nickname tab and you should be able to make your name as long as you want!

[There you go! Now all your friends and teachers can laugh at your extremely long name. Maybe not the teachers.](https://preview.redd.it/jm9qpf0uc9g81.png?width=1264&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a305bd7f94a90f455512d06b61ece414a2f5fcf4)

But flatypus! My teacher turned on the friendly nickname generator! Whatever could we do? Well, you're in luck, because some genius found a way to bypass that too!

1. First, you want the [redirector extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/redirector/ocgpenflpmgnfapjedencafcfakcekcd), found here. (I'm not affiliated with them in any way, but the source code is public [here](https://github.com/einaregilsson/Redirector) for any coders.)
2. Next, visit [here](https://easrng.github.io/kahoot-namerator-bypass/), the kahoot name bypass website; all it does is generate a json file that you import into the redirector. (If you're skeptical about this website too, don't fret; its also available on github [here](https://github.com/easrng/kahoot-namerator-bypass).)
3. Open the extension by clicking the extension button at the top right corner of your browser, and click 'edit redirects'.
4. Click 'import redirects' and import the .json file you got from the bypass website.

Now, whenever you join a kahoot that uses the friendly name generator, the redirector will automatically change the name to the name YOU want!

(note, since this uses some API thing, don't use names over like 1000 characters; it just breaks the website lol.)

Hope this was helpful!

# HOW TO STOP OVERTHINKING

Overthinking is simply the act of thinking about something too much or for too long. it is also a state of mind when the mind is ruminating on thoughts,past/future events,ideas...etc which will lead to creating a loop of worries,stress and anxiety.Generally overthinking is caused by the person's inner struggles like fear,lack of self worth,self doubt and low self esteem.  
**Here are tips to help you get rid of overthinking habits:**  


### 1-Be aware of your thoughts

pay attention to your thoughts pattern because this will make you gain control over it,try to identify each thought and trace it back to the moment of its creation.then ask and answer yourself honestly about why and how you are thinking this way.mostly,it is deeply related to your limited beliefs and inner struggles.  


### 2-Let go of what you can't control

examine your thoughts and suurender to the fact that you have no control over certain things,so worrying and overanalysing it wouldn't change the situation.instead, focus on what you can control or change at the present moment and take immediate action afterwards.  


### 3-Focus on the solution

begin to shift your attention to finding a solution rather than just keep ruminating the situation in your mind.this will change your perspective about facing triggering situations or problems and save your time and energy.  


### 4-Eliminate ""what if's""

you should deeply believe that things work by a divine plan that you can't see right away,whether you're overthinking past or future events,if you're wondering if you have acted differently maybe things would've been better now,then the only thing you can do now is trust that whatever happened was meant to be.however for future events,all you can do ""now"" is take action and believe that whatever would¬† happen tomorrow is meant to be too..  


### 5-You attract what you think

our mind is more powerful than we might think,so if you are thinking positively about a future event and imagining all what could go right rather than what could go wrong,you are embodying your imagination in real life and spreading positive energy inside and outside you which would send your mind signals to attract the same energy in your reality.so the image you expose to your mind is so important as the mind can turn imagination to reality.  


### 6-Stay present

when you don't have control over your mind,your thoughts would run loose non stop which may even extend to complicating unrelated matters of the past or future and creating problems which will put you in a state of intense worries.all you you need to do is concentrate on your present moment and be conscious on the ""today"",neither yesterday nor tomorrow .  


### 7-Right-size the problem

somethings are more worthy of obsessing over than others,so you got to carefully choose which situation is worth devoting your time and energy for and which one isn't,this will lessen the pressure on you and protect your peace of mind.  


### Conclusion

there two things you should know : if you control your mind and use it wisely and properly,you will be able to control your life ,the second thing is that everything handled ""overly"" like OVER-thinking,OVER-working,OVER-planning...etc,is not healthy and affects our life in a negative way.

My idea for this list is to help me focus on how to seem confident, trustworthy and professional, maybe it'll help you too. For some extra pictures from the movie, check out the link above...

Principles

**1. Relaxed body language**

WHY: It helps other people feel relaxed too and builds up your confidence.

HOW: Spread yourself out comfortably. Move yourself freely. Have eye contact on special occasions.

**2. Be non-reactive**

WHY: If you are non-reactive it shows you are not pressured by what‚Äôs happening around and have all the control.

HOW: Simply don‚Äôt react, stay silent under pressure. Pause and breathe.

**3. Don't try to convince other people**

WHY: It helps you be persuasive.

HOW: Frame yourself as an equal partner, be willing to walk away.

**4. Signal good health**

WHY: A healthy body carries a healthy mind.

HOW: Keep your back straight, posture upright and radiate positive energy. Try to smile.

**5. Believe that you will be ok**

WHY: This helps you tell the truth. You will stop worrying about rejection, and will never be weak.

HOW: Live it and be practical.

**6. Make your clients believe in you**

WHY: How much would you trust being on a plane with a first-time pilot? What about being on the table of a first-time brain surgeon?

HOW: Emit competence. Make decisions swiftly and act firmly. Don‚Äôt hesitate. Avoid showing weakness.

On average, people urinate between 6 ‚Äì 7 in a 24 hour period. So we call that 6.5 X per day on average.  Depending on the plumbing in the erection (I mean a *building*, not the other kind of erection!), it usually takes 10-30 seconds for the hot water to reach the faucet.  So we can use 20 seconds as a rough estimate. 

6.5 uninations per day X 365.25 days per year X 20 seconds of waiting for the water to get hot each time = 47,450 seconds, or 790.83 minutes I'll save every year using this method.

\- Through my insurance I had a fitness program that let me join a ton of gyms for $30 a month. I think that's logical. In 2022 my job changed insurances and I lost that benefit.

\- New insurance doesn't have that benefit. We do have this LifeMart thing or something like that where there's an ""Active Fit"" subscription but the options are crappy and much more limited.

So now I'm trying to figure out if there's any other ways to get gym memberships. I started looking at Credit Cards perks to see if any are offering something like that.

_re_cursion_,t2_nlif8,1643604278.0,"Tired of being the ""crazy uncle"" or the ""whack job cousin"" at family gatherings? Done with being the ""lunatic fringe"" at parties? Don't like being fooled into falling for conspiracy-theory based scams? Exhausted with how your ideas keep shifting as you accept new conspiracy theories and reject old ones? Tired of alienating all your friends with crackpot ideas?

I have a method that might help you. I was born somewhat vulnerable to that sort of thing, but I've been working on upping my resistance to it for over 15 years. Now, I'm one of the LEAST conspiracy-minded people I've ever met. If you're like me, the key is using innate rigidity to counter it. You don't necessarily have to do this part, it's optional, but: In my case, I stopped accepting ANYTHING where concrete physical, logical, or mathematical proof doesn't exist. Yes, this means I had to abandon religion; that was sort of the ""crack"" in my mind that allowed all the weird stuff to get in. I also had to reject any form of supernatural beliefs wholesale; that was another huge vulnerability which led to all sorts of junk thoughts/ideas.

Then, implement a series of criteria (they work best if you choose not to believe in anything supernatural/religious period, like I did  - but they MAY still work if you don't, I just won't make any guarantees) for all ideas/conspiracy theories presented to me:

1. Profit test: Is there a concrete profit motive - a real reason why the purported culprit(s) would benefit financially or personally from taking part in the scheme?

2. Possibility test: Can it be explained by science - is there a known physical, real mechanism accepted by the scientific community  by which it could be done? (no supernatural crap allowed - this test is really important)

3. Incompetence test: Could it be done by a real group of people? Imagine, for a moment, that the supposed conspirators were replaced by people you know in real life - would they be able to do it?

4. Group size test: Does it AVOID requiring a large number of people to keep a secret? (large groups are incredibly leaky / suck at keeping secrets)

5. Adverse motive test: Is it IMPOSSIBLE that the person telling you the theory would benefit in any way from you/people believing in it? (if they could benefit from lying to you about it, they probably _are_ lying)

6. Source test: Does it come from a source which is respected and known to be reliable? Do they have any legitimate, provable credentials that could explain how they found out about it? Does anyone respectable trust them?

7. Efficiency test: If the theory includes a more efficient/cheaper way of doing something, are businesses/corporations using that method on a large scale? (eg: water dowsing would DEFINITELY be used by corporations IF it worked, because it would be so much cheaper - but they don't use it, which is good evidence it doesn't work; cold fusion clearly doesn't work otherwise we'd definitely be using it for power already to solve climate change)

8. Dependency test: If the theory were true, would everything we do in the modern world still be possible? (example: the world CANNOT be flat because ships and planes fly around the world on a pretty regular basis, and satellites can be seen orbiting; also, gravity would be partly sideways on a disc world, which it clearly isn't - and, to cap it off, astronauts and ALL trustworthy field experts KNOW the world is round.)

9. Secrecy test: If the thing is supposedly secret, is there actually a concrete reason why they would actually benefit from / need to keep the thing secret - and if there is, is it even possible for someone to find out? (if someone is claiming to be the discoverer/whistleblower, see test 6 again)

10. Internal consistency test: Does every part of the theory/idea agree/work with everything else it says? Is the story entirely consistent? Does the story stay exactly the same when you ask questions or talk about it again later? (eg: if someone tells you that the moon landing didn't happen because the government is lizards, but the next time you ask they say it's because the government is horse people, then you know they're probably feeding you a load of crap)

11. Occam's Razor test: Is it the simplest explanation, and does it best satisfy the above criteria out of all the possible options? (if it isn't or it doesn't, it's probably not true)

If the answer to ANY ONE or TWO of the above tests is NO, then whatever they're trying to tell you has a 90% chance of being complete bulls***. If the answer to THREE OR MORE of the above tests is NO, then whatever they're trying to tell you is DEFINITELY complete bulls\*\*\*.

ONLY if the answer to ALL the tests is YES, should you really consider the possibility that what you're being told MIGHT be true. It COULD still be bulls\*\*\*, but if it passes all the tests, the odds are _much_ lower.

If you strictly apply this method, you won't fall for bulls\*\*\* and you might even gain a reputation amongst your friends for being down-to-earth and having reliable information.",Falling for BS conspiracy theories on a regular basis? Try this.,lifehacks,False,0.0,1.0,1.0

Finally, spin your corn like a log roll directly on the stick of butter, moving left and right as needed to cover the length of the cob.

shankey_1906,t2_1lvoywjq,1643498447.0,"If you are working on your keyboard all day, you can get a significantly better typing experience by using few simple lifehacks with minimal $. 

1. If you use a keyboard whose height is not to your liking, just add some cabinet door bumpers to the bottom of your keyboard. The sticky side ensures they stick to your keyboard properly and the squishy side ensures your keyboard has a firm grip on the desk. You can get a 100 pack for a few dollars. 
2. Some keyboards are way too small (magic keyboard) which is not too ergonomic if you use it alone with a wrist rest. The height of a single cabinet bumper might not be enough, in which case you can use it along with double side tape which are usually \~2 or so mm thick. Use multiple layers to get the desired height and add a cabinet door stopper at the end. You can use this method to also change the angle of the keyboard. 

Both of these combined are less than 10 dollars and might upgrade your typing experience without upgrading hardware.

I'm 30, moving alone, and don't have ""alot"" to bring. I will be buying new furniture/TVs &amp; all that once I get out there. The stuff I need to bring now is basically 2 large suitcases of my clothes, a large office desk, workout equipment &amp; some other medium sized heavy items. Since these won't all fit in my Ford Focus, and I was planning to drive out for the move, I was considering 2 options:

1. Rent Uhaul van &amp; trailer (with my car on trailer), drive out &amp; drop the stuff back at a Utah Uhaul location. I liked this because once I get there, I'll want the Uhaul truck to pick up mattress &amp; couches same day before bringing it to Uhaul for drop off. Anybody tried this?
2. Pack what I can in my Ford Focus &amp; ship the rest (at least 2-3 bulky 50lbs+ items)

digdug78,t2_o9prv,1643461506.0,"Large plastic soda bottles are much cheaper than smaller ones per volume, but they have the problem of losing the carbonation if not consumed quickly.

There are a number of known hacks (immediately empty the large bottle into smaller glass bottles for future consumption, keep it stored cold and upright with a tight lid ) , and some which even appear to be myths (squeeze out the leftover air of the bottle, or use a air pressure pump)

I've come up with an extra trick which I haven't seen online, and thought I'd share... it goes as follows:

Once your bottle is starting to go flat, open a new one. After pouring a glass, top up the new bottle with the flattish Coke so that it is full again. This works well for me because brand new large bottles are usually very fizzy, and diluting it a bit is not a problem. Leaving the bottle full means the bottle loses less fizz while storing it as there isn't much room for the carbonation to escape into. When reopening the bottle days later there isn't such a loud fizz sound (meaning not much CO2 leaves the bottle on opening, yet the Coke remains nice and fizzy).

I use this way when dicing up onions and tomatoes and such and decided to use it with garlic tonight and my life has been forever changed!! 

Basically, you cut lines leaving a little bit of space at the top to keep the clove together, at your desired thickness, then flip it to it's side that you haven't cut and cut that down the center still leaving room at the top. From there, go to the end of the clove that's been cut and chop towards the top... BAM QUICK AND EASY DICED GARLIC.

So I saw that [Crypto.com](https://crypto.com/) offers free Spotify Premium for their users and here is my review to this:  
Here you can find where they mention the free spotify: [https://crypto.com/eea/cards](https://crypto.com/eea/cards)

Shortly about the company:  
Crypto.com offers Visa debit cards that give 2% cashback for every payment. Recently [they started a huge ad campaign starring Matt Damon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hBC5TVdYT8) and they [bought the naming rights to the Staples Center in L.A. for 20 years](https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2021-11-16/crypto-staples). Next to the cashback of 2% they also offer free Spotify.

They have different options of Debit Cards. The Ruby Steel card tier offers a **$25 instant bonus, free Spotify and 2% cashback on all purchases,** and a metal card. To get the card you need to stake ‚Ç¨350 worth of CRO coins and hold it for 6 months. After this time you're free to sell your CRO them again (or keep if you want to retain the card benefits).

**Important note:** you don't need to put crypto on the card, you can just load it with Euro or USD and spend it!

All cashbacks (Spotify and 2% of every payment are paid in the CRO cryptocurrency. You can immediately sell the CRO in the app for pounds/euros, which you can use again for purchases with the card if you want.

\--

**Personal experience:**

I've been using the Ruby Steel card for two months now. After my staked ‚Ç¨350 I got the Ruby Steel card and a bonus of $25 worth of CRO. I loaded some Euro on the card and changed my payment card on Spotify. After about two weeks my first payment of the monthly Spotify Premium went smoothy through and [Crypto.com](https://crypto.com/) paid the $12.99 back with CRO which I sold for Euro again. Smooth and really easy to do so.

Also the metal debit card looks awesome :)

My partner's solution is to just take the shower head off its bracket and put it down by the drain so you couldn't hear the dripping anymore. This of course does not solve the collosal waste of water.

It then occurred to me that the reason it starts dripping 3-4 hours after use is due to the seals contracting as they cool down.

I have now started running the shower on its coldest setting for a few seconds before I turn it off to pre-cool the seals so they're already cold when I turn it off. And it's worked! Hurrah! No more 2am shower dripping!

Seeking the advice of any health professionals out there: I‚Äôve always been a pretty decent sleeper. Throughout my adult life I‚Äôve probably averaged 6-7 hours per night. 

Over the last year, my work/life schedule has changed and I‚Äôve been able to sleep much more. And I‚Äôve taken advantage of it! For the last year I‚Äôve averaged 9-10 hours per night; occasionally 11. I love it and I feel great. 

I‚Äôve always believed that sleep is one of the best things for your brain, immune system, mood, etc. However, when talking to friends about sleep recently, a few people have said they think that at a certain point, excess sleep can actually have a negative impact on a person‚Äôs health.

I'm hoping and wondering if someone can help me.

I had to factory reset my Samsung phone, but have run into a big problem as I can no longer access my Google account which was signed in on this phone, so I can't sign in and continue to use my phone anymore and it's just stuck on the Google log in.

I've been researching and looking for a way to bypass the Google login after a factory reset but a lot of this suggestions are not helpful.

A lot of the suggestions are telling me to download a Google account bypass app onto my phone, but I obviously can't do this as I can log into the phone to access the play store or downloads.

I downloaded a bypass software to my tablet and plugged the phone in to try and bypass the Google account but it didn't work and all of the other PC software suggestions didn't work or weren't able to download them.

I can't afford to pay for bypass software right now and can only use software that is free but I'm struggling to find something which works.

I've searched and searched on Google but have found no solution, so I have had to reach out to the intelligent minds on Reddit that can hopefully help me out.

Does anyone know how I can successfully bypass my Google account after factory reset and set up my phone?

I cannot log into my Google account at all, I don't know what's wrong with it but I'm unable to reset my password and can't get in anymore, and therefore cannot use my phone, which I desperately need to work as I have no other phone and this phone cost me a lot of money and I only just bought it recently and I'm not able to afford to take the phone into a shop to get the Google account removed/bypassed either so i am desperately seeking a free solution which I can do myself at home that works.

I'd appreciate any suggestions, thanks","Samsung Factory Reset, Google Account - Locked And Blocked",lifehacks,False,0.0,1.0,1.0

Mondays can be really frustrating especially if you didnt rest enough for the weekend and you just have to jump into the next week. It just makes the rest of the week easier to get through if the start of it goes really good. After a while your subconscious starts looking forward to Mondays and realeases extra dopamine once you reward yourself. Only downside is you are horny every Monday.

Jaguar-Aggressive,t2_8rddgn7d,1642587403.0,"I recently found out about this website and it works like charm, have been using it for about 2 months and received about 400$ worth of products. At first, I thought it was a scam judging by the poor quality of the website.

You need 2 things to qualify:-

&amp;#x200B;

1. Have an Amazon Account at least 6 months old
2. Have at least 5 Amazon reviews(If you don't, complete it and come back to this post)

Also, if you don't have any previous orders, you could just buy 5 products from Amazon and then return them, you could still be able to review, try to have good reviews tho

Next, Sign up on [this](https://www.eirevine.com/Buyer/signin?is_invite=us&amp;utm_source=refer&amp;utm_campaign=online&amp;utm_medium=30124432) website, you could start small by buying something cheap but useful(that's what I did because I wasn't sure if this was legit), once it's delivered post a 5-star review, and then submit a screenshot of the review on the website, they will reimburse you the money on Paypal or others, if this doesn't work(which it has been for me) you could always return the product and get your money back from Amazon.

I suggest not to try to get Money from Return as well as Rebate as that will just get you banned and even though you might make some money, you're literally stopping yourself from getting stuff, I tried doing that and you're somehow banned to use other emails as well.

Full Disclosure: the link is an affiliate that will make me some commission but I have also tried it out myself and found value in it which is the main reason I posted it here, if it doesn't work, you could downvote this.

drzgy,t2_hygokcki,1642541940.0,"If you ever get frustrated because your cloud storage is taking too long to sync files, or isn't syncing the files at all or is not behaving as expected, the problem might lie with the data you are trying to sync and not the cloud storage service itself. After a lot of frustrating trials, and in some cases loss of data, I have learnt these valuable unsaid rules for cloud storage.

1. If there are too many small files, e.g. 20,000 less than 100 kb, try to zip them and upload. It will be much faster to zip-upload and download-unzip as required for use. 
2. If you need to zip files which are too large, try splitting the zip files in 1-2gb files. Cloud storages have hard time syncing more than 5gb files and sometimes it can take multiple trials to sync the file which wastes a lot of time.
3. The cloud storage seem to prefer folder structure when performing a sync. Limit having a number of folders with few files. It'll be much faster to sync 100 folders with 100 files each compared to 1000 folders with 10 files each.

I will post more as I learn more. Feel free to comment your preferred methods. Hope it helps anyone struggling like me.",Best ways to use the cloud storage,lifehacks,False,0.0,1.0,1.0

ccafferata473,t2_pmr3i,1642475894.0,"So I have a to do handman type list for my house. This weekend, I had a few car related things to do - wipers, refill washer fluid, headlights and turn signal, air in the tires. Most of the tasks went fairly smoothly - except for the headlights and turn signal. It took me 3 hours to do change the headlights. Why may you ask? Simple - it turns out my car (2012 Chevy Malibu) requires that I take out about a dozen 10mm bolts, a dozen plastic clips to remove my front bumper. And that's before I can unscrew the headlight housing to replace the bulb. 

Needless to say, after a lot of awful words and some scrapes, I hit an epiphany:

1. Write down all of the maintenance skills you know how to do - it could be knowing how to use a screwdriver to welding. Anything basic tool related skills.
2. Do online research - there's enough information out there on maintenance costs and the like, it's worth spending the time to understand what you're likely going to put in the car.
3. Once you've got it down to a couple of cars, hit YouTube - search basic things like tire changes, headlight changes, where the intake is for your fluids (wiper, oil, tranny, etc.) and watch the videos to see if you're capable of doing that.

I hope this helps as a life hack - you'd be surprised how much you could do with a little patience, some basic tool skills and a little foresight and research.","When purchasing a car, be sure to check on how to do your regular maintenance.",lifehacks,False,0.0,1.0,1.0

bjnc89,t2_1f8cr65n,1642376500.0,"I just got my first round of winter snow where I live. I have 2 cats, Penny and Alice. Penny uses litter box no problem, but Alice was a stray and does not like using the box, she has to go outside.

I let Alice out to pee, and 5 minutes later realized how dumb I was. Now the cat would likely hole up somewhere and there'd be no way to get her in, and it was getting dark soon.

I tracked her paw prints in the snow to the house across the alley from us, where no one lives currently. She likes to go under the outbuilding and hide. I call her name and of course she wont come out. I go back into my house to regroup.

I start to think. What draws predators- like cats- almost without fail? 

Injured prey.

I went on YouTube and opened the first video that popped up on search; an injured starling distress call. I then grabbed my bluetooth speaker and sat it outside under our outbuilding roof and retreated back into the house, connected the speaker to my phone, and hit play. I could hear the loud screeches emanating from the speaker from where I was, inside the house.

No sooner than 5 seconds after I hit Play, a black and white head popped out curiously from under the outbuilding. Intently peeking her head up into the air, she swiftly crawled out from her hidey hole, and began moving in the direction of the speaker. I waited until she got a few feet from it, then made my appearance outside.

Luckily, Alice is the type that doesnt run from you, as long as you carefully move towards her while lovingly talking to her. ""Heyyy, kitty kitty... what're ya doing out here??‚ò∫Ô∏è "" When you get close enough, you can just reach down and pick her up with little protest other than a resigned ""Mwreeaaoorrr..üòë"" 

I then hoisted the lanky furball back into the warm house, and all was well.

So, if your feisty feline wont answer your kitty kitty calls, give this trick a whirl.

If you dont possess a bluetooth speaker, the same results could probably be achieved by opening your window and setting your phone on the windowsill, with speaker oriented facing out the window. Maybe place it in an empty shoebox placed on its side to make a improvised speaker amplifier.

mikayla_rivera,t2_veq5w,1648762384.0,"On Christmas Day, I got a speeding ticket driving to my parent's house for breakfast. It sucked especially since I had just spent quite a bit on presents for my family and was also transitioning to a new job. 

It was raining, and the cop that pulled me over was quite a bit in front of me and was also driving. I was speeding but was at the speed limit again by the time I was about 5 car lengths or so behind him. Despite this, he pulled back behind me and pulled me over anyway. I ended up getting a hit with a fine for about $300-400 + traffic school.

Now here is the part I didn't know, it only cost me $99 to get a lawyer and so far my lawyer pleaded not guilty for me on Valentine's Day (my court date lol) and now my case is on hold for possibly the next 6+ months. So not only do I not have to pay for my ticket or go to traffic school anytime soon, but I actually have a good chance of winning my case.

FYI the officer that gave you the ticket has to show up to the case and show evidence to prove the conviction otherwise the case is dismissed. If this case is dismissed, you avoid points on your record, traffic school, fines, insurance increases, etc. and this was all for $99. 

Reasons for a lawyer:

* More time to get money for the ticket if you do lose
* Possibility of reduced fine
* Potential Errors on Ticket = dismissal
* Radar Gun/Traffic camera can't be proven to have correct calibration when the ticket was issued = dismissal
* You were going above the speed limit because of safety reasons like to avoid an accident = reduced fines or dismissal
* Officer got the wrong car = dismissal
* Officer didn't have a clear view = dismissal
* You have already used your traffic school or you already have points on your record and cant have another ticket

So in the case that you do get pulled over, make sure you know what the officer is stopping you for, write down details of everything in the moments before getting pulled over(surroundings, where the cop was, where you were pulled over, if something effected your ability to follow traffic laws, etc), and don't argue with the cop.

SunstyIe,t2_ha7v6,1648761219.0,"We see ads everywhere we go on the internet, and while many people get served ad content they like since the ads are targeted to our interests, it can be problematic when you're being served ads for things you don't want to be tempted by. 

For example, maybe you're trying to lose weight but getting hit with fast food ads. Or you're trying to stop drinking but you're consistently shown ads for alcoholic beverages. Or perhaps you had a pet die, but you keep getting shown ads for pet products and it's bumming you out. 

The good news is that you can change what ads you are shown fairly easily.

A large portion of ads we see on the net (\~30%) are served directly from Google, and a good many others buy their data from Google. Ad data is personalized on a per-user basis based on what a person searches for, what sites they visit, what content they interact with, etc.

Google allows you to directly see what they know/assume about you, and what your interests are. They (and advertisers) use this to influence what ads are shown to you. Thankfully, they also allow you to mark items as not being of interest to remove you from the ad pool. But don't think of it as altruism on Google's part- they want their ads to be more effective, and so if you self-select what you're interested in then they can advertise to you more efficiently. 

To view and update your Google ad interests, click here and turn off any ""interests"" you don't want to see ads for:  [https://adssettings.google.com/](https://adssettings.google.com/) 

That will impact ads you see across a huge number of places on the internet, and will give you some control back on what is being shoved in your face constantly.

Also, anytime you see an ad for something you don't want advertised to you, check to see if the platform has a button for ""Why am I seeing this ad?"" (ex fb and ig). Click it, then select ""I do not want to see this again"". Repeated use of that tool will influence advertisers behavior since they won't want to waste money showing ads to people that aren't interested.",LPT: You can change what ads target you across the internet with a few simple clicks,LifeProTips,False,1.0,1.0,1.0

‚Ä¢Yes, you should have a diet with healthy foods and fiber (vegetables, etc.), but it's equally important to make sure you drink lots of water so your body can digest the fiber better (prevents stool from becoming too dry/hard, which can lead to straining). Water is key.

‚Ä¢Don't bring your phone or a magazine into the bathroom and distractedly sit on the toilet for 10+ minutes. Too much time on the toilet can put pressure on the veins in your rectum, which can lead to hemorrhoids. The goal is to get in and get out as quickly as your movement is over.

Quick story:
44m, sedentary most of my adult life. I was 80lbs overweight and found the Intermittent Fasting community. 

After 8 months of calorie counting/IF combo, I lost over 60lbs. I thought about adding exercise, but was so excited at the results I thought‚Ä¶ why bother? 

Well apparently if you sit for a living, and lose weight quickly, without doing any strength training or muscle building, it can cause a host of health issues; more specifically- coccyx and pelvic floor dysfunction (affects bathroom, sex organs, and is extremely debilitating). I have not sat since October of ‚Äò21 because of chronic pain from this condition.  No driving, no vacations with the fam, missed teaching my son how to drive, and the kids first roller coaster.

danielrosehill,t2_poc45,1648636786.0,"I do my best, like all of us, to minimize my exposure to spam telephone calls. 

However, there's only so much that any of us can do (short of enforcing a call whitelist which is probably the most robust method available but which is also problematic if, like I, you run your own business and occasionally need to field calls from unknown callers).

Over the years, I've developed a few common defenses - one of which I see was just posted on this sub.

Because I am an English speaker living in a non-English-speaking country I have an easy go-to in pretending to only speak English and not the local language. 

If that fails, I have memorized how to say ""I only speak Norwegian"" in Norwegian - assuming that the likelihood of the telespam caller happening to be a Norwegian must be vanishingly small. I recommend that everybody have this phrase on hand in whatever language is sufficiently obscure in the part of the world in which you live. 

But what if you pick up a call only to discover within seconds that it's a telesales spammer trying to sell you on marketing research?

Frequently I just hang up and then block the number. But sometimes one wants to hear the person out just a little longer. In other instances, one simply doesn't want to be so callous.

My new go-to for these situations is to pretend to be a gatekeeper to myself. 

I use the name of a non-existent personal assistant and say that I will bring the message to the attention of me ""if it is of interest"" -- which makes me feel slightly better because that part isn't a lie at least. Given that there's a 99% chance that whatever they're selling isn't of interest I won't be passing it on -- to myself. 

The sales caller now assumes I hope that they've gotten through to a PA with no purchasing power and I of course never pass on anything. 

Using this method, they seem to give up on the chase after one attempt, hopefully marking me off their call list as not worth bothering with.",LPT: Memorize the name of a fake virtual assistant and have it on hand for any unwanted phone calls,LifeProTips,False,1.0,1.0,1.0

I always thought that the people who went all the way to end of lane were real jerks, who tried to skip a few cars instead of merging early. TIL, I was dead wrong.

The Texas Transportation Institute conducted a study and concluded that zipper merges are actually faster, safer, and more efficient than merging early, especially when there's traffic. Zipper merging is where each car works collaboratively to allow one car from the right lane to merge left to form one line, just like in a zipper. In some places like Illionois and countries like Germany, zipper merges are law! 

Why is this faster? Because traffic buildups often occur when cars in the merging lane aren't given space  to merge, thereby bringing all the cars in that lane to a total standstill. When these cars then try to merge from a dead stop onto the path of oncoming traffic, they often cause collisions! Zipper merging means that both lanes are fully utilized and the vehicles in the merging lane can carry their speed into the highway.

1. Stop having FOMO. That 30% off is tempting, but don't buy clothes solely based on price. Try it on. Take photos of what you like and go home. You might find for cheaper online or maybe they'll actually have it in your size. If you're still thinking about that item a few days later, then go buy it. 


2. You want the best deal? Do your research. Use Google Lens to search for similar looking items in other clothing lines. Check second hand online retailers like Poshmark and ThredUp. Buy things towards the very tail-end of the season for the best deals. Avoid fall/holiday shopping.


3. Choose appropriate fabric. Expensive clothes need expensive maintenance or you will ruin them and waste all your money. You don't need to use silk pajamas, cotton is more durable and can be easily washed (imo). 


4. Shoes are the one item where you never want to buy one size bigger or smaller. Not talking about how different brands size differently. But never purposely try on shoes and buy a size up, thinking ""you'll grow into it"" or ""close enough""...You could twist an ankle that way. 

5. Find a tailor or learn to do some basic alterations. Everyone's body is different, and you won't find stuff off a rack that was designed to fit you. There's always something. In most cases, for a pant, get the hips to fit and everything else can be fixed. For a shirt, make sure the chest and sleeves aren't too tight, you can fix everything else.",LPT: Buying clothes?

This is a trick for situations when you find yourself in an argument with a loved one or peer that you trust is, at least, not a complete narcissist (for whom this trick won‚Äôt work).

&amp;#x200B;

Arguments break down and become unresolvable when each side is focused only on vindicating themselves. To that end, some times arguments seem like a competition for resources, with both sides trying to ‚Äútake, take, take.‚Äù People are way more willing to fairly consider your side of the argument if you cooperate with them by first offering consideration of their side. So, when attempting to argue your side, begin with acquiescing some aspect of their argument first. First ‚Äúgive‚Äù, **then** ‚Äútake‚Äù. Template:

&amp;#x200B;

‚ÄúI can see how \*insert some aspect of their side you‚Äôre willing to concede\*. I just also think that \*insert some aspect of your side you want them to acknowledge\*.‚Äù

&amp;#x200B;

Offer one for them, ask for one for yourself.

&amp;#x200B;

In an argument, it **does not matter who is more correct, pragmatically. What matters is what can come out of the argument constructively. When you focus too much on your side being right, and their side being wrong, the argument is only destructive**. For this reason, appealing to each other‚Äôs psychology by offering respect will cut through the toxicity like a hot knife through butter.

&amp;#x200B;

Conscious_Total01,t2_iodjtqwy,1648512269.0,"Let me start of by stating that I have been to therapy with 3 psychologist. Currently I can't afford a private session and been trying to book a session with the college Counselors from January with no success.

I don't know if it's depression or what but I often feel like I live in another planet/universe,  out of touch with reality. Majority of the days/weeks I don't know what I did. I don't eat, drink water, bath or  even think. It's feels like my body is here and my mind in somewhere doing god knows what. 

Once after a week and a half somehow I do manage to study and actually prepare a meal. Reply to messages on WhatsApp, reach out to people, take walks etc... I usually take notes tracking what I did trying to find the thing that allowed me to do all the activities. But after that day I subsequently go back to the state of living I hate and after few days I will ""wake"" to the reality and usually by that time the food I had prepared that day, would be rotten with a bad smell and I would eat it. 

I currently live 2 hours from my home and the last time I was home my cousin told me his birthday is on the 25th of March. I promised to come. When the week started I was clear that I'm going home for a weekend Friday I will be with my family celebrating a birthday, Saturday I will see my girlfriend and go meet few of the friends I had not seen in a while but the biggest part was being with family and I had planned to give my parents some money. On Wednesday I confirm that indeed I will be home for the weekend, I text my friends that I will be home for the weekend. from Thursday to Sunday I don't know what happened. And I didn't go home as I had planned. I only woke up to the reality on Sunday night. Took a shower and went to dispose rotten food and prepaid new meal and worked on the assignment. I'm supposed to submit this week, then went to sleep.
 
During the festive season I had an opportunity to talk with my grandfather and asked him a lot of questions. Which made me realise what could be the potential cause of the way I live. Therapy wasn't working because we couldn't figure out the root course of the problem. My grandfather never worked, has no friends no interest. He spends his time inside the house (want to live alone) and occasionally if it's too hot sit outside. This is a life I see myself leaning towards. At least he does this consciously. My sister is like this also. I don't know if they enjoy their lives because I don't and I don't see myself living like this my whole life. I'm in college, being in college from where I'm from is a blessing and I have seen my capabilities and things I could achieve. My goal and dreams are possible but the only thing stoping me is these days that are unaccounted for. 

What I'm asking for with this are tips you think might help me. Live everyday.

Secondly, the only way to lose weight is to burn more calories than you take in. Eating specific foods will not magically make you lose weight.
A calorie is simply a unit of measurement. If you want to LOSE weight, look up/count how many calories are in the food you eat, and weigh yourself consistently. If you‚Äôre gaining weight or staying the same, reduce the amount of calories you eat by a small, non dramatic amount. On the other hand, you can add more exercise into your day to burn those calories off.

That‚Äôs it. That‚Äôs all there is to it.
The ‚Äòtrick‚Äô, the ‚Äòmagic secret‚Äô to weight loss is just finding out how many calories you consume, and reducing it. If you don‚Äôt lose weight, reduce more.
The only reason healthier foods are good for weight loss is because they have fewer calories. 
The only reason junk foods are bad for weight loss is because they have high calories.
It really doesn‚Äôt matter what you eat.
The only reason exercise is good for weight loss is because it burns calories.
If a fad ‚Äòdiet‚Äô says you can lose weight by cutting out these three foods, or adding these three instead, you‚Äôre being mislead. Calories in, calories out. Easy as that.

TLDR: The only way to lose weight is to consume fewer calories than you burn. It‚Äôs not about the type of food, just the calories.

BlastedBrent,t2_nw6yiv9,1648494034.0,"A bit of oldschool advice, but I've never really seen it talked about before. This might be because the option to Hibernate has been automatically hidden for most people since the windows 8 days, so you may need to [manually enable it in the control panel](https://www.groovypost.com/howto/enable-hibernate-mode-windows-10/)

Hibernate is essentially just putting your pc to sleep in a way that can survive losing power, combining the benefits of a proper shut down with the convenience of sleep.

The ""trick"" is simple, next time you need to unplug your pc or want to enter the bios:

1. Set your PC to Hibernate in the usual power menu
2. Pull the plug
3. (move your pc or take it apart or whatever you need to do)
4. Plug it back in
5. Power it on (you'll get a chance to enter the bios here)
6. After it posts, Windows will resume normally as if it was waking up from sleep

I'm sure most of us are aware of hibernate, but I figure since the option has been hidden by default for so many years, there are a bunch of new pc users, and it was always sold to us as a power saving feature--it might help some of you.

So I stopped brushing my teeth on a daily basis for a very long time and now all I do is drink squeezed

ORGANIC lemons with distilled water. I don't drink the pasteurized lemon juice in squeeze bottles or

the giant GMO lemons. When I first started this habit I didn't realize how beneficial it would be to my

teeth. I did it because I liked the way it made my teeth feel and also my breath smell. I will probably

floss my teeth every once in a while when I FEEL like its time do so or brush them if need be. Ususally

its weeks or even months in between and my girlfriend doesn't think my breath smells bad at all. Their

was a time before when I used to brush my teeth everyday and floss and eat a lot of sweets I would

always wake up with morning breath and my teeth just didn't feel that rigid or strong. Ever since I

have started living this way my teeth not only feel stronger but look healthier as well. The reason I

made this post is because everywhere I look on the internet about drinking lemon water it says TO

NOT DO IT. It will strip your enamel and blah blah blah. I think a lot of the cons that come with

drinking lemon water come from mixing it with tap water which is filled with GOD KNOWS WHAT. If

you want to learn more about what is in your local tap water go here

([https://www.ewg.org/tapwater/](https://www.ewg.org/tapwater/)) and just punch in your zip code. THe 50x, or 60x just means that is

how much extra of that chemical is in your tap water beyond the recommended government limits.

Also, I don't think the stuff we brush our teeth with is very healthy for us either. They put fluoride in

the toothpaste. I mean seriously how does that even make sense that we are doing this to ourselves

and accepting it as rational behavior. Honestly the proof is in my own personal experience. I just

wanted to share this with people who are afraid to drink lemon water. Just make sure you mix the

organic lemon juice with DISTILLED water. I squeeze one lemon into a 24 oz cup and if I decide to get

more water I will squeeze another lemon so usually I only drink 1 to lemons a day. Their is no harm in

doing so. Experiment for yourself. The toothpaste and tapwater will do more harm to your body than

drinking lemon water IMO. Have a great day everybody and thanks for reading.",LPT I drink distilled lemon water everyday,LifeProTips,False,1.0,1.0,1.0

A LIABILITY is NOT an item you can buy. A liability is DEBT. try not to purchase debt, wherever possible try not to buy credit. you have to pay interest on it. YOU take on the risk of insolvency. Debt grows exponentially. if you don't pay regularly, it will go to infinity. causing bankruptcy.

UNLESS that credit is funded for by a business. Businesses have profit but could also go insolvent or take losses, business owners take on risk, inherently. The share or stock of the business you buy takes on the risk of insolvency. Think of a house as a low risk business. the share of stock of the business is the house price, the net profit of the business is the rent cost, minus any taxes and upkeep fees, the risk of insolvency is secured by the house (the share of stock). Higher risk businesses generally produce better yield (return on investment). You may purchase shares in any kind of business, doesn't have to be a house as long as you are willing to take on the risk and grow it to make a profit as an entrepeneur, you can take home profits after paying all employees and costs, or you can reinvest those profits to further grow the capacity of the business. on the other hand you may purchase stock of publicly traded business, this is equivalent to owning a share of a business passively. you may receive a dividend if the business continues to be profitable, or if the business reinvest their profit and grows, then the stock price will go up with the share price, and you may sell at a profit minus fees. investing or trading in exchanges of stocks is literally the same thing as trading shares of businesses, except the share isn't determined by the ACTUAL value of the share, it is determined by supply and demand (publically traded). Traders assume that the market is efficient enough to figure out the share price accurately and fairly, meaning as share goes up positive correlation, stock price goes up. and the companies benefit from the extra public capital from investment. it can be risky, but through statistics and intelligence, you can control that risk by reducing volatility and increasing probability of success and increasing profitability with respect to some target in time/indicator. this is what stock traders do.

Money goes down in value with respect to the same goods and services, except in a recession,  this is inflation. only in a recession do you want to keep money.

so you will want to purchase ASSETS/business with spare money. this is risky, but is the only way to really make money. except for working. working is a situation where you yourself are an asset.

the other thing you may do with money is put it into savings accounts and make interest from it, this holds almost zero risk but you don't have freedom to change your mind and control and your money is locked in.

the other thing you may want to do with spare money is spend on bonds. this is to interest what public stocks are to private shares. bonds are essentially interest payment plans, except the price of the payment plan is decided by the free market. you would expect as the interest rate goes up, people will want to lend their money on other plans, so the bond price sells for a lower price. negative correlation.

the other thing you may want to do with spare money is spend on commodities. commodities can be liquid fungible like gold, silver, other currencies, bitcoin, oil or non fungible and non liquid, like paintings and watches. you may want to hold a significant portion of these, but you will more likely want to actively trade them than just hold them. they could rise or fall in value with respect to your currency. it is notoriously more difficult to make money by investing in other currencies (forex) than it is to buy stocks of business. they do not lose their value, but their value can fluctuate.

Ex1, Scenario: your partner has been emotionally distant, and has not been spending ample/meaningful time with you.

You statements with absolutes: ""*You're always* pushing me away these days. *You never* want to spend time with me. *You* *only* hang out with me when you have nothing better to do"" 

I statement with minimal absolutes, we-statements, focusing on emotions: ""Lately, I've been feeling far away from you.  **When** the only time *we* spend together is at the very end of the day, **it makes me** ***feel*** like *our time together* happens only after *we* are done with everything else. That makes me feel like spending time together isn't a priority *we share*, and *I am hurt when this happens in our relationship*. I'm feeling lonely and abandoned, and I don't want to feel this way...Is everything ok with you? I'm wondering if you're pulling away because something else is happening. I want to understand if you're struggling with something, either within or outside of our relationship. *I am here for you.*""

Ex2, Scenario: your partner continues to put dirty dishes into the sink, rather than directly into the dishwasher.

You statements with absolutes, and character assassination: *""You never* put the dishes into the dishwasher, no matter how many times I've asked. Are you a child? Am I your parent? I don't understand why you can't just do this simple task, it drives me crazy.""

I statements with no absolutes: ""**When** you put your dishes in the sink, rather than load them into the dishwasher, **then I feel** like you're expecting me to put them away for you. *That makes me feel like you don't respect me*. *The story I'm telling myself* is that it's a simple task that you're choosing not to do on purpose. I trust that you're not actively trying to disrespect me, but it still feels disrespectful. It feels like you don't care about how this impacts me, and that isn't a good feeling. I don't want to feel this way with you... What are your thoughts? How can we work together to address this?""

Ex3, Scenario: your partner has not been physically affectionate, nor have you had sex in quite some time.

You statements with absolutes, contempt and criticism: ""We haven't had sex in ages. *You never* touch me, do you even want me? Am I just that repulsive to you? You don't put *any* effort into our sex life. *I feel like I'm married to a fish*"".

I statements without absolutes: ""Lately, I'm starting to feel like you don't want to be close to me. *We* haven't been physically connecting *very often*, *we* haven't hugged or kissed *a lot*, and *we* haven't had sex *in a while*. **When** we aren't physically affectionate with each other, **I feel** scared that you don't want me. Right now, I'm feeling rejected and I don't want to feel this way with you... Can I ask, why do you think this is happening in our relationship? I want to understand your perspective so we can address this together. I want to fix this as a team.""

Using I-statements, We-statements, focusing on the emotional impact of behavior, and avoiding absolutes are essential factors to a **soft start up.** When we start hard conversations softly, with centering our *experience*, rather than feigning to have a factual interpretation of what's 'actually' happening, it's easier for someone to respond empathetically. Absolutes open the door *immediately* to defensiveness, because it's an invitation to argue about whether that is *always* happening or *never* happening. It's also easier to be critical or contemptuous towards our partner when we utilize you-statements, rather than I-statements. I-statements center the discussion on the emotional reality of one person, and invite the other person to empathize with them. We-statements infuse conversations with a sense of partnership, teamwork, and reminds the other of the shared goals. Always build understanding first: What are each of you feeling? What is each person's perspective? *Only when both parties feel understood is it time to problem solve, and remember, sometimes the only solution needed is to feel understood.*

Some of the provisions were unfunded leading to lower income districts struggling to comply while also being held to the same strict standards of wealthy districts.

I put in my 30 day notice at a hospital working in general surgery as an RN. Decided to protest with signs due to none of my requests to fix equipment, raise wages, increased on call shifts, and addressing staff issues over the months.

I finally have a meeting with HR and raise all of these patient safety concerns. Their only concern was using the buzz word ‚Äúpatient safety‚Äù to address short staffing, no breaks, etc. They didn‚Äôt care about fixing anything meaningful. The are worried about the chain of command and keeping their job like good little sheep. 

That night HR calls and they accepted my resignation 2 days in, and said they would pay me the remainder of the 28 days. Well, 2 months later, last week, I call, and they have nothing on file about paying me. 

They got me out of the way to protect the company from lawsuits, and creating too much noise addressing all of the things you hear about with employee retention, mental health, increased shifts, and patient safety.

Hospitals should not be run solely by business men/women. Healthcare is a different animal, and lives are on the line. Keeping labor costs down and profits up should not be a priority.

TLDR: HR is in place to protect the company from lawsuits, not help the employee with concerns in the work place.","LPT human resource is in place to protect the company, not help the employee when issues arise.",LifeProTips,False,1.0,1.0,1.0

Shoes, clothes, cars, motorcycles, phones, laptops etc are all liabilities. If you buy something for $100, next year it will be $80, the year after $60. Eventually zero 

Assets like property, land, stocks/shares, digital assets are likely to increase in value. If you invest $100 today, it might be $110 in a year or $120 in 2 years. 

So my general advise is that an investment with a 10% compounded return will triple in 11 years!!

If I understand it correctly, to learn better, you need to make mistakes, then correct them. This only works if you already know the answer. And if the mistakes are conceptual, not like spelling mistakes or whatever.

The article gives the example:

&gt;To illustrate, for ‚ÄúBats are mammals that fly,‚Äù an acceptable response would be, ‚ÄúBats are ~~birds~~ (mammals) that fly.‚Äù 

You see, assuming that bats are birds is a conceptual error. In other words, they are mistakes in perception and interpretation.

Just lay out your methods, emphasizing their advantages while mentioning the disadvantages of other methods. Unless there's just a huge hole in your logic, that's what decision-makers will remember.

What would you do if you were me?

I'm a single 30-year-old living in Boston that have been with my company for 5 years. I recently got approved to be remote meaning that I can work remotely from wherever. I love this idea because I love to travel and could spend time away from Boston during the harsh winters. Recently, I got a new opportunity arose with a different company where I could be making $20K-25K more but would require once a week in the office days. In two years I could get promoted at this new company and make $60-75K more than I am now. I already make very decent money ($200+K) and have two rental properties.

My question is should I be concerned about moving up the ladder or go enjoy life than worry about making more money/moving up the ladder in a few years? Also, how much do you value remote work lifestyle?

HappyFun_Time,t2_jkkynqwr,1648278946.0,"Many desire to be happy, but not all are able to achieve it, and fewer still to maintain it. A lot of people expect happiness to appear before them, whether in the form of friends, a promotion at work, or a winning lottery ticket, and they focus on attaining these things as if it would solve most of their problems and make them truly happy.

Many things do make people happy of course, for almost everyone has hobbies or things that make them smile. But this happiness is often transient, with many losing it once the moment ends. Thus, the happiness that many desire is not happiness per se, but oftentimes contentment instead, when you are simply happy for what you have and where you are in life.

Being content does not mean a lack of ambition or a desire for change, but rather it is a state of acknowledging that what you have is already enough for you as a person. Although easy to say, it can be very difficult to achieve, for a minimum of 3 things must first be accomplished.

The first is minimum, or the absolute necessities needed for a reasonably comfortable lifestyle. No matter how positive one's outlook may be, maintaining happiness when one does not know when the next meal will be, or whether or not there will be a roof over one's head by nighttime, is extraordinarily difficult. However, once this minimum requirement is met, then any additional resources may grant increased opportunities for happiness, but far from guarantees it.

The second requirement is meaning. A life without hope, or one without meaning, is a life yet lived. Meaning is what motivates us, and hope is what allows us to keep moving forward. It is what allows us to feel that we matter, that we can actually make a difference in this vast world. In the end few may achieve their dreams, but hard work betrays little, and the act of striving towards a goal is in itself often what makes life worth living.

The third requirement is mindset, and this is most important of all. No matter how much one may possess, no matter how few obstacles or hardships they may face, if one does not have the right mindset then happiness may never be achieved. Despite what many might think, mindset is not as simple as comparing yourself to those less fortunate however, for the same argument could be used to claim that one could always compare themselves to those more fortunate. Instead, a proper mindset is being able to see the value of everything you might have or experience. It could be as significant as a mother's love, to something as small as a stranger holding open a door for you, for both of those actions acknowledge you as a person - that you exist and that you matter.

Happiness is not straightforward, and it is different for everyone, but happiness itself can never be given. Affluence may satisfy the first requirement, and offer opportunities for the others, but it cannot guarantee them. Meaning may be suggested, taught, or even granted, but unless it is borne from the heart of the individual carrying it, will never be genuine, and with mindset being similar. Thus, happiness is not given but found by the one that seeks it.

Happiness requires a conscientious effort, it must be grasped, and it begins with the letter M (minimum, meaning, mindset).

Thank you for entertaining my perspective. I am sure many may feel differently, and I recognize that happiness is much more complicated than this, but these are my personal ramblings and I hope that it may help others.","LPT: Happiness can never be given, it must be grasped by the person that desires it",LifeProTips,False,1.0,1.0,1.0

Casual disclaimer that this isn't medical advice nor is it a guarantee to work it's just something I discovered that helps me and it might help you.

Anyway...I have tinnitus. It's not noticeable until I'm in a quiet place, or trying to fall asleep. Then it can feel like my ears are ringing very very loudly, as though I can hear a constant high pitched ambulatory /emergency tone.

It used to really bother me until one night, while I was sleeping, I thought to try to see if I could still hear pure silence even if my ears were ringing. Not sure what made me think to try, but what I did was I switched from passive listening to active listening, and focused on my ear drums, and I tuned out the noise like it was background static and tried to detect any sound at all. Sure enough, the ""tone"" of tinnitus began to shift from inside my eardrum directly, into the back of my head. I began to realize that the noise I was hearing was more of a response to ear damage, than an actual sound I could hear. So while I had the tone inside my skull, just to the left / right of my ear, I began to breath slowly and concentrate. I imagined that there was a ""volume dial"" in my brain to ""turn down"" the volume of my tinnitus. It sounds crazy...but it worked. The one was significantly reduced, and I was able to briefly trick my brain into only hearing silence. 

Sometimes, the ringing comes back, but every time I try this technique it either gets rid of the tone, or is able to ""turn it down"" significantly. I feel like by concentration, meditation, and active listening for noise instead of passive listening when I hear tinnutus, I've been able to teach my brain to distinguish between ""imaginary internal noise"" and legitimate environmental sounds.

Hello,   
 

I am approaching a job offer soon and wanted to know if I can negotiate (maybe) a higher salary if they don‚Äôt meet my expectation, a higher performance bonus and also a sign on bonus?   
 

The offer I currently expect for a senior Finance Analyst: 112k - 115k base, and 10% performance bonus.   
 

What I want to counteroffer with: 115k base, 15% performance bonus, and also a 15k sign on bonus.   
 

Reasons behind my counteroffer: I have interviewed with other companies (some of which were in the same industry and some not) a good number of them said that the 115k base, 15% performance bonus were within the range and had no issues meeting that so I am using these other companies as a benchmark behind my counteroffer. Also seems that from my research for the specific area/industry/job what I want to ask for is reasonable.   
 

Reasons behind the sign on bonus: If I leave my current company I will be missing out on about 18k worth of performance bonus + profit sharing from the current company so I want to make up with the sign-on bonus I plan to ask for.   
 Is that a reasonable request? or maybe I should ask for more/less sign on bonus ?   
 

I‚Äôd like to hear your insights and thoughts when it comes to negotiating.

calebbogart7,t2_2dsua9xl,1648137271.0,"So I‚Äôm sure everyone has been through this scenario: you‚Äôre driving on a 2 lane highway, and you come up to 2 slow cars ahead of you in both lanes that drives side to side next to each other going the same speed leaving no room or chance for drivers behind them to pass. Well this is quite common in bigger busy cities where driver awareness is just non existent. But where I live, a much more peaceful and small community, where things like this just doesn‚Äôt happen. I always call my town the ‚ÄúAmerican autobahn‚Äù because 99% of drivers move to the right lane when they see cars coming up behind and they know they‚Äôre slow. It‚Äôs incredible. But still I‚Äôve actually had encountered a situation like this at the beginning of the year, where I was driving on a 2 lane mountain highway and the sedan ahead of me in the left lane was obvious trying to block me/traffic from overpassing. Because every time there‚Äôs a driver on the right lane, he‚Äôd start driving EXACTLY the same speed as the other driver, blocking the lane. It was obviously intentional. There was even a semi that he tried to drive the same speed with. But it didn‚Äôt work out long, because both times the other drivers probably got annoyed and weirded out that there‚Äôs a car continuously driving next to them, so the other drivers eventually slowed down, leaving room and space for me to overtake the idiot. However, on my way to work today, this same thing happened again. And I‚Äôm sure it was intentional too. Because when I was trying to merge onto the highway, there‚Äôs this car that just had to get ahead of me in the merging lane, refusing to yield. And then after getting ahead of me, he immediately moved to the left lane, which is something he could‚Äôve done before the lane merged. But that‚Äôs fine, I don‚Äôt really care. So I was driving behind him in the left lane, and there‚Äôs traffic on the right lane. As soon as the traffic cleared on the right lane, he moved to the right lane and started driving exactly the same speed as the slow car now ahead of me. Keeping in mind this was very obvious that he‚Äôs doing it on purpose because he was suddenly slowing down to match the speed of the slow driver ahead of me. Leaving no room for me to pass or overtake. And I thought, that‚Äôs fine, the car ahead of me will probably move over just like usual. Boy I was wrong, the car ahead of me in the left lane just continued driving in the left lane, having no intention of moving over nor does he seem bothered with the fact that there‚Äôs a car driving right next to him all this time. And you could tell the idiot on the right lane was doing it on purpose even more so because every time the car ahead of me slowed downed a bit, or sped up a bit, that‚Äôs what he would do as well. I got really pissed, this lasted for about 1.5 miles before I was able to exit. I was close to honking the horn but remembered that my family always told me these people has empty lives and just wanted someone to play games with them. So I didn‚Äôt. And it wouldn‚Äôt really helped anyways. But I‚Äôm just wondering, have y‚Äôall ever encounter this? What if this was like a 20 mile road and they just kept going like this?

PrinceHal9000,t2_xni21,1648127449.0,"I'm writing this for those who are feeling overwhelmed, frustrated, defeated, angry, or generally just anxious about the current state of the housing market in the US.  I'm also writing this for those who are curious (morbidly so?) about what is going on, how we got here, and where it is going. 

HOUSING CYCLES  
Housing prices tend to follow boom and bust cycles.  Boom cycles are characterized by soaring prices and massive demand.  During bust cycles, plenty of housing is available for sale, but no one wants to buy, people are afraid to buy, or can not afford to buy it.  Over a long enough time frame, housing prices have historically appreciated, but it is not a linear process.  In my lifetime as an adult, there have been two big busts which saw housing prices drop significantly (the 2008 financial crisis and the immediate years after and for like *three to nine months* when COVID hit in 2020) and two big booms (the years leading up to 2008, and late 2020 through March 2022 as I write this).

It's important to note that the above analysis of housing cycles is WAY TOO GENERAL, because housing is predominately a LOCAL market issue.  A boom in the NYC market may coincide with a bust in the Detroit housing market.  The pain (or euphoria sometimes, but it's mostly pain) felt by local people trying to buy or rent locally  is unique to each locality.  Media tends to publish lots and lots of articles trying to generalize the problem nationally (because people like to read these articles and that's just what news media does), but no two *local markets* experience the same thing.  Some experience busts while others boom, and vice versa.

WHAT IS GOING ON?  
Even though each housing market is different, the price of housing in each market follows some  balance of SUPPLY and DEMAND.  Below are some specific issues related to the current state of housing in the US that are contributing in different proportions to the current boom in housing prices experienced in many markets.

DEMAND ISSUES  
1 - Interest Rates:  Interest rates have a very strong effect on what a buyer can afford to spend on housing.   Interest rates were kept near zero for much of the last ten years.  Eventually, more buyers have grown capable of affording to spend more on housing.  Prices have risen according to the increased demand.  Rising interest rates SHOULD depress demand and prices, as purchasers can afford less.  
2 - Remote Work:  As more companies adopt WORK-FROM-ANYWHERE policies, people who were formerly forced into expensive local housing markets in big cities can now enter a wider variety of local housing markets, driving up demand in local markets to new levels.  You WOULD THINK that this would result in price reduction in big cities, but that hasn't really happened and I don't totally understand why.  Maybe lots of city people just changed cities, resulting in no net loss to demand (NYC to Austin, Austin to LA, LA to NYC)?  
3 - Increased Retirement:  COVID caused an increase in earlier-than-expected retirement and many chose to sell homes in or near higher-priced city markets and move to (formerly) less expensive *retirement* markets.  
4 - Downsizing:  High prices cause some people to sell to ""downsize"", this can particularly drive up the cost of previously ""affordable"" homes as downsizing sellers seek less expensive property (usually as they head for retirement)  
5 - Higher Wages:  People are earning more, WHICH IS GREAT, but that means more people can spend more on rent or enter the housing market, increasing demand for houses.  
6 - Asset Appreciation: The stock market has risen, as have some other risky assets, and that is raising net worth.  It allows asset holders to liquidate those assets and convert it to housing.

SUPPLY ISSUES  
Put simply (and generally), there aren't enough existing homes to feed the demand in many local markets for a few reasons:  
1 - New Construction Supply Always Lags:  This is kind of obvious, but as more people enter a new local housing market, more housing will need to be built.  Houses don't grow overnight, it takes time to build new housing.  
2 - Lack of Construction Labor:  While demand for new home construction is high, labor hasn't expanded at a rate fast enough to meet the demand.  This is slowing the rate of new home construction.  
3 - Lack of Construction Materials: Construction materials are hard to come by and are expensive due to demand and supply chain issues.  This slows down construction and increases construction costs.  
4 - Legislation/Policies:  I'm not an anti-regulation guy.  I think regulations are necessary, but regulation tends to make it more difficult and expensive to build housing.  It's also very hard to craft good legislation that doesn't have unintended consequences.  Some areas (think major cities, California, etc.) are more heavily regulated.  To build anything, a developer is going to need an army of lawyers to get anything done.  Whenever armies of lawyers are involved, things tend to get a whole lot more expensive and move a whole lot slower.

WHAT TO DO ABOUT IT  
1 - Be Patient and Have Perspective:  When prices are soaring, markets go crazy and people think *it's never going to end, this time is different, government please do something!*  When prices are crashing, people panic and think *the world is coming to an end, this time is different, government please do something!*  Prices boom and bust.  The best thing you can do is have your finances is good shape so you can act when the market *eventually* turns and prices are in your favor.  Housing purchases tend to be coming later and later in peoples' lives.   Interest rates are starting to rise again which should have a significant effect on prices and demand in time.  You are not screwed if you didn't buy a house in your 20s or 30s.  I know this is cold comfort for those who are facing severe housing pressure right now, but be as patient as you can be.  
2- Be Mobile:  Housing prices should NOT be booming everywhere by the same amount.  There should be markets where housing is affordable.  If your job is mobile, and you don't have family commitments restricting your mobility, you can explore other markets that may be more favorable.  
3 - Don't Obsessively Consume Media Related to Housing:  Contemporary News Media is kind of designed to grab your attention and hold onto by any means necessary - scaring you or provoking your outrage is one of its primary tactics. Endless doomscrolling is not going to help your mental state.  
4 - Rely on Yourself:  Your ability to earn a living is the most important aspect of your financial outlook.  Earning more and saving more now puts you in a better position to enter the housing market later.  
5 - (For current renters) Build a Good Relationship With Your Landlord:  Landlords really value GOOD TENANTS.  A good tenant always pays on time, doesn't trash the place, never has cops called, etc.  The better relationship you can build with your landlord, the more they will want to keep you as a tenant, rather than risking bringing a tenant who will pay more, but might be totally awful.  This is obviously harder if your landlord is a large building corporation than an individual, but you can still be cool to the staff and people you interact with.  People are were may more likely to give you a good deal if they like you than they are if you are pain (unless they are shady and exploitative).

Okay that was too long and way too pedantic.  I probably missed a ton of things and screwed a bunch of stuff up.  For my own understanding, I'd like to see what aspects I missed - so if you see anything, let me know!",LPT - Some Perspective on THE HOUSING MARKET,LifeProTips,False,1.0,1.0,1.0

I‚Äôm going through so many thoughts right now (undergrad college student), mainly relating to friends. During the past few months I have been busy because I was trying to spend quality time with some of my family from abroad, whom I don‚Äôt see so often by the way (It might have been about 3 years since the last time I‚Äôve seen them). My friends have been inviting me to eat/hang out with them during those past months, but I had declined in a FRIENDLY way because I really did want to spend time with my family, since I barely get to see them. I even told them that I‚Äôve been excited to spend time with my family. That makes sense, right? Wanting to spend quality time with people you don‚Äôt see as often, especially if they‚Äôre your family?
Well, family has left and went back to their home, which is all the way across the other side of world. I‚Äôve been more free now and I thought my situation from the past few months was understandable and wasn‚Äôt a lame excuse, because I truly did cherish family time.

I had spent time with my friends a couple of time even when I was busy, but often had to decline due to spending time with family; my friends knew that. One of my best friends is also in that group, but it seems that she is leaning more on her other friends for enjoyment.

I found out today,  from a licensed trauma therapist, that when someone tells you they are a sociopath, it may be one of the few times they are telling the truth.  They must be believed and you need to cut ties as quickly as possible,  for your safety. 

Sociopaths don't feel the shame or embarrassment the rest of us would if we were accused of having sociopathic traits. They literally are not capable of feeling most emotions,  although they are adept at mimicking them,  if they feel they can use emotion to gain an advantage over someone. 

In addition to not feeling shame or embarrassment about being a sociopath,  it's an indicator that you may become one of their victims,  if you aren't already.  Sociopaths freely admit they are a sociopath so they can later avoid taking responsibility for their actions.  The victim is then held responsible for the abuse they endured because ""they were warned"" and ""allowed"" the abuse to happen.  

Taking responsibility for their actions or feeling remorse for hurting others is outside the capabilities of sociopaths.  They literally are unable to feel empathy.  So even though they may acknowledge they have hurt you,  they don't care. They are always looking for a personal benefit or advantage and have no issues destroying another person if it benefits them.  

Pay attention to language, as it may be an indicator.  For example,  a sociopath may say ""I apologize"" when they have harmed someone.  But they will not say ""I'm sorry"" for the actions that harmed their victim.  Although it may take someone a bit to catch on,  there is a difference in the two phrases. I apologize is a statement &amp; they feel that is adequate enough to pacify someone.  However,  I'm sorry indicates they are taking responsibility for their actions that caused harm.  Although they're capable of telling people what they think they want to hear and excel at lying,  even a simple statement like I'm sorry can be nearly impossible because they don't accept responsibility and they don't actually feel remorse.","LPT: If someone tells you they are a sociopath, believe them.

Since I was young I noticed when eating kiwi my mouth became tingly and there was a slight burning sensation. I thought nothing of this because other fruits like pineapple had a similar effect, and I learned that pineapple has a digestive enzyme (Bromelain) that basically breaks your mouth down. I figured something similar was happening with kiwi. 

I mentioned the burning to one of my friends and they agreed with pineapple but said they had never experienced it with kiwi or any of the other things that made my mouth tingle like celery or peaches. An internet dive led me to oral allergy syndrome (OAS). 

Oral allergy syndrome is more common in people with seasonal allergies and the types of foods that cause the symptoms match your allergies (ie there are different sensitivities if you are allergic to grass, birch, or ragweed). Some people describe a tingly sensation like me, others describe an itching or burning. Some people with ragweed allergies also have this effect from certain edibles. 

The tingling goes away if you cook the fruit/veggies. There is no treatment for OAS and as long as the sensation isn‚Äôt too unpleasant for most of the allergens you can just keep enjoying.

Jameteed50,t2_1cn49h,1648007165.0,"As an adult, I think it's important to cultivate something called ""Win Management"", or ""Success Management"". It's basically another way of saying ""being humble."" Humility is one of those unspoken skills we build as people, and a form of emotional IQ.  I feel it goes hand in hand with building confidence in your life as well as building security within yourself. 

As we get older, we may get more wins under our belt. By ""Wins"" I mean achievements that you KNOW would impress people on some level if they knew. Say for example, you get a really nice car, or a nice job/career.  Maybe you've recently lost of weight, etc.  Although it may seem like common knowledge, just carry yourself like you've been there before.  

For example, say some guy recently gets a Lamborghini.  He goes on a date and all he talks about is how great his car is. Then the other person says ""He is too cocky"". What  they really mean is the person tried too hard to use his ""wins in life"" as a means to get people to like him. The guy is basically conveying the message, ""I need you to know I drive that Lambo in order for you to like me and respect me."" Same could be applied for any similar ""high accomplishment(s)"".  

Carry yourself like you don't need to rely on that ""win"" as a crutch to have people like you and respect you. Carry yourself like you don't need to flaunt your wins in someone's face, as if your putting all your eggs into that basket to get people to like you. Let your personality and vibe do that work. Of course, if it gets brought up, talk about that; but don't feel like everything has to ride on your ""wins"" otherwise you are not enough. There's more to your story than that.

Now I'm NOT saying that you shouldn't work hard in life. It's VERY important to elevate ourselves in this life and to take your life VERY seriously because honestly no one else will. Getting more ""wins"" in life is good. But when you get those wins, remember to be tactful and socially aware enough to not feel the need to shove it in people's faces, and move with grace. The more you excel in life, the more you won't even feel the need to flaunt those achievements. I'm not just talking external achievements, but also in loving yourself and developing security with who you are over time.

The Department of Transportation figures show that under-inflated tires waste about 5 million gallons of gas *every day* in the United States.

The U.S. Department of Energy says that for every 1 psi missing from your car‚Äôs set of 4 tires, you lose 0.1 percent of your gas mileage. (Every psi lost also means that tires wear 10 percent faster.)

By properly inflating your tires, you can improve your gas mileage by up to 3.3 percent. This means that cars getting 30 mpg could see a benefit of about 1 mpg with properly inflated tires. 

This benefit seems small at first, but when combined with tire savings this amounts to a significant sum over time.

meshtron,t2_q1m1oms,1647924825.0,"First job out of school, I was the college-nerd engineer in a rough, union manufacturing facility.  I learned a lot from those days.  One lesson that has stuck with me in the decades since then, and that I have shared countless times with people who I worked with and then who worked for me was this tip.

A guy - we'll call him Jack - was the Maintenance Lead at my plant.  A big, burly, bearded mountain of a guy with a deep voice who was the local union president.  Good guy.  He busted my chops hard but I finally earned a grudging respect from him.  Every time I'd see him I'd ask ""How's it goin, Jack?""  Every time he'd answer ""It doesn't get any better than this!"" with a smile obvious though but hidden behind his prodigious facial hair.

One day I advanced this banter a little further and said ""Man Jack - you always give that same positive answer.  Do you really believe that or do you just want me to shut up and go away?""  He feigned an emotionally hurt look and said I could take solace in knowing if he didn't want me to talk to him, I would never need to wonder about it.

What he said next, though, was the real nugget.  He explained to me that he had barely graduated high school.  Never been good at math, never cared much for reading and didn't get along well with most people because most people are assholes.  And yet, here he was with a 40-hour a week job, owned his own house, had the respect of his peers, interesting people to talk to, and very little stress to deal with.  He said it LITERALLY didn't get any better than THIS JOB, FOR HIM.  He further explained that if he ever thought maybe it should or could get better, it would damn well be on him to explore that and go find out.  Not listen to what his sister's husband told him, not believe what the other union guys were saying about how much better some other job was, but go get it - do it - live it to know if it really was better.  And, for him, he couldn't imagine many ways - with his skills, desires, and values - to be doing much better than he was.  So, he came in every day.  Early.  Made coffee.  And answered anyone who asked how he was doing with ""It doesn't get any better than this.""

It comes up most often for me in work conversations, but I think the gist of the advice is broader than that.  Here are my takeaways:

* Every one of us has finite limits on what we're capable of
* It is possible - even likely - that consistently operating at those limits of capability does not necessarily align with what you'd LIKE to be spending your time on
* It's up to each of us, individually, to work out the math on what the right balance is for us and seek it
* This equation often changes over time, adjust accordingly
* If you THINK you can do better, go effing find out.  There is risk to taking that leap, but every spec of energy you spend on believing you should be doing better is wasted as resentment against actually taking action and finding out
   * Don't talk about it; be about it

I think this advice applies to relationships, personal health, financial freedom, etc.  The principles are similar.  Spend your energy on first understanding what success looks like to you, second on working towards that, finally on making sure you maintain that alignment.

For example, you'll always start at the fruits and vegetables section. It makes you feel like you got the healthy food and then you allow yourself to buy more junk. Another one is that the entrance is usually on the left, because people are more likely to look right. So here are some quick tips:

1. Don't go shopping when you're hungry. Shops use the smell of bread and chocolate (usually from the bakery) to make you buy more food. 

2. If you don't need a lot of things, take a beg instead of a shopping cart. 

3. Create a shopping list and arrange it according to the store's sections (as much as you can). Avoid entering to sections that you don't need to go to. 

4. Look above and below you. Usually the most popular/expensive products will be right in front of your eyes. 

5. Compare prices base on both the price and weight. Don't be afraid to buy unknown brand. In many cases, the food will taste the same.

Sorry if this has been posted before, I tried looking for other posts but couldn't really find one that applies.

I bought a ticket with Spirit airlines on March 4th from LAX to San Juan Puerto Rico on for May 18th. There is a slight chance that I will not be able to make that flight, and have to delay for about a week. The problem is, I won't know until just the week before.

My question is, what is the best way for me to handle this? I'm not super familiar with flight change and cancellation policies, and I'm having a hard time interpreting the information.

Would my best option be to wait and change the flight, or should I try and book a second ticket and cancel the one I don't need? What are the factors I need to consider? If this is not something that can easily be answered like this, how can I go about finding out what's the best option?

Many of us start our day by immediately checking our phones, then get ready for work or school, then spend all day working or learning, conversing with peers and colleagues, doing chores and errands, and when we get breaks and downtime, we immediately fill them with reading news, scrolling social media, and watching television.

When was the last time you truly had no distractions and were able to just be alone with your thoughts? When was the last time you were neither doing some sort of productive task nor consuming some sort of entertainment? Even a walk in the park is commonly injected with entertainment by listening to music or podcasts.

Many people use formal meditation to attain some quiet reflection, but lots of less formal activities will work too. For instance:

* Taking a walk
* Cuddling your pet
* Going to the gym (and not listening to music or watching television)
* Eating a meal alone
* Driving to or from work (if it's an easy peaceful drive without traffic)
* Cooking an uncomplicated, easy meal alone
* Doing a low-stress hobby, like knitting or fishing

If you're a super logical person, you might think this is a waste of time. But I guarantee that your partner, friend, or family member will benefit from the conversation much more if you stop throwing solutions their way (no matter how rational they may be) and listen, ask questions, and validate their feelings.

If you find your start feeling panicky or your pulse starts to race AFTER the anaesthetic injection goes in it is likely to be the adrenaline in the local anaesthetic. You can ask your dentist to make a note on your records to use local anaesthetic without adrenaline in it to make things much more relaxed in future.

Adrenaline (small amount) is used in dental injections along with xylocaine or lignocaine/lidocaine. It‚Äôs meant to help reduce bleeding around the site of surgery. It doesn‚Äôt actually seem to make much difference to my dentist for me to have it without and I don‚Äôt get any of that horrible adrenaline rush any more. The anaesthetic works 100% just as well and seems to work just as quickly. 

This advice has completely changed the way I feel about going to the dentist now. I made the switch 20 or so years ago and went from dreading a visit to happily sitting having root canal completely numb but nice and relaxed. 

I‚Äôve worked as a surgical assistant in the past and I would still recommend having it with adrenaline for skin surgery however.

Applying ice to the surface doesn't tend to get it cold enough, and a freezer takes a long while and once it is out of the freezer for a while it heats up again so you often have to do it over and over again before you get an optimal result. 

C02 in a can, used for cleaning dust out of computers and other tight spaces, generally has a liquid propellant in it that becomes super cold when sprayed out of the can. If you use the can as directed, only the air comes out, but if you turn the can upside down, the liquid comes out and freezes anything it touches. 

Instead of putting your item of clothing in the freezer for an hour or more, simply spray the liquid onto the area the gum is stuck to and it will freeze it instantly, making it way easier to scrape off in a shorter amount of time. You can do this repeatedly until as much gum as possible is removed. The entire process takes about 5 minutes.

WARNING: Be sure to wear multiple pairs of rubber gloves so that you don't give yourself frostbite, and do this in a well ventilated space so that you do not inhale the propellant.

What I'm referring to is small, friendly favours. Let me give some examples. Say you have a really friendly neighbor who you're on really good terms with. His garage is bordering your back yard and he wants to expand it can fit his new car. He either cannot do it on his property or it would make it much easier if he could expand it from the back (so he wouldn't have to deal with the murder-door-spring).  You're really good buddies, its in the back corner, only 2ft over the line, doesn't bother you, you say yes. Then after five years he sells his property to some real assholes and they decide that since a garage is clearly a more permanent structure, your fence is clearly on their property and you have to move it. Ensue bothersome proceedings and cost.

It could easily be avoided with a simple contract. ""I, the owner of xyz, allow my neighbor John Smith to expand his garage into my property by so much and he and all future owners acknowledge that it is on my property and agree to remove the part that is on my property within a month of receiving a written notice to do so"".

Or, they can't fit their new RV on their property that is bordering your huge field. They ask if they can park it there. Or they want to renovate something and it would be much easier for the builders to access it from your property and they ask for temporary access. Again, a contract, clearly stating what, where and when. You, my dear cousin, can park your RV across the street from your front yard. You, dear neighbor can drive some equipment over my property for the duration of work. If not clearly defined, such temporary arrangements have a nasty habit of becoming permanent and even expanding. Your cousin could park there and so the new owner assumes he can park his three extra trucks on your field. It came with the property. They could access their back yard over your property, surely I can now drive over it whenever I want.

Of course, the best thing to do in such cases is to just sell the land. But sometimes it is really temporary or the other person doesn't have the money or maybe you don't want to sell. If it ever comes to a situation like this, write a contract and get it notarized. It can save you a lot of headaches in the future. And before you think that stuff like this doesn't happen. It does.

jayellkay84,t2_3yadsvwu,1647654060.0,"Coming from a discussion with a coworker today. I live in Hurricane country and it continues to boggle my mind that people buy a few extra cans of creamed corn and call it their emergency rations. You may be without power for a while and it may be a while longer before you can get real food again. A can of creamed corn a day isn‚Äôt going to keep you full or satisfied. 

My current stockpile as a single person (I rotate through and replace), which I hope to last at least a week if needed:

1. At least 2 16 packs of toaster pastries. I eat these daily for breakfast anyway. 

2. Bread and peanut butter. I always have an unopened backup. 

3. Canned beans (and I‚Äôm not talking green beans but more like black/kidney/garbanzo and similar) are my main canned staple. They provide protein and slow digesting carbs and will keep you fuller longer. I keep about 10 cans on hand. 

4. Canned tomatoes pair well with the beans and often come seasoned. 10 cans. 

5. A couple cans of peas, green beans, mushrooms and pineapple for variety. Probably only 10 cans total. 

6. Canned meats (chicken and tuna, though salmon/sardines/spam would fall in this category). Again about 10 cans. Protein will keep you full. 

7. Single serving fruit cups. Remember you may not have anywhere to keep your opened cans from going bad. 2 4-packs. 

6. Granola bars, dry cereal, dried fruits and chips/pretzels/cookies. I don‚Äôt keep a set number but they are on hand. 

7. When the power comes on and you can cook again, you may very well be sick of canned food, but the grocery store hasn‚Äôt restocked and restaurants that are open may be crowded. So, some boxed pasta/rice/other pantry food that requires cooking but not refrigeration is nice to have on hand. 

8. Seasoning. Hot sauce. Packets of salad dressing that don‚Äôt need refrigeration. Salt and pepper. You don‚Äôt want to eat bland food. Prepare now so you won‚Äôt suffer then. 

The longest my power has ever personally been out was 4 days for Hurricane Irma, but you never know. And don‚Äôt wait for a storm to approach either. Start buying a few cans now. Worst case scenario you donate them at Thanksgiving, or cycle through them like me.","LPT: When you‚Äôre stockpiling non perishable goods for an emergency, remember you actually have to survive on them in an emergency",LifeProTips,False,1.0,1.0,1.0

I went to the #1 ranked program in the country in my discipline for graduate school and went to a top 20 program as an undergraduate. People think that the only places you can get a truly excellent education is at one of the top-tier universities in the country. This is not true, and I will tell you why:

Who is teaching you? Professors, of course. How do they become professors? By getting a PhD from a university. This has unexpected implications.

Take a look at the faculty in your major at, let's say, Dartmouth College. You'll see that the faculty all got their PhDs at prestigious institutions -- Harvard, Stanford, Columbia, UCLA, etc.

So you would think, then, that if you are someone who got your PhD at, let's say, UPenn or Harvard, you would end up teaching at a place like Yale or MIT or Cornell, etc.

Nope.

The vast majority of PhDs who come from these high-ranking institutions end up teaching at more middling places: University of Kansas, Lehigh University, Kenyon College, UC-Riverside, etc. Now, it is \*also\* true that a few of them will end up at those top tier places, but this is the exception, not the rule.

Why?

Because there are way, way more graduates of the top-tier PhD programs than there universities at which they can be hired. Imagine a single graduation year, where the top 15 schools each produce 5 PhD graduates. That's 75 people looking for a job. But in a given year, it is unlikely that those 15 schools are hiring any more than 1 new professor. So you'll have 15 of those 75 getting jobs at other top-15 universities -- and the other 60 have to find jobs elsewhere.

So why does all this matter?

If you go to, let's say, Penn State -- a good but not great school -- and take a quick look at the chemical engineering faculty -- you'll find people from MIT, UC Berkeley, etc.

Ok, so?

At almost ANY of the top 120 or so colleges and universities in the country, you will find either some or MANY faculty with absolutely top tier backgrounds. You can find absolutely fabulous faculty at almost any university. The key is that you have actually to show up in office hours, ask them questions, discuss your interests with them, etc. These are people with PhDs, from the best universities in the country, who have been conducting research for years. Absolutely any thought you've ever had about their discipline is likely a thought they have had as well -- this means it is possible to have conversations about things that are enlightening in ways you never thought possible. They will sharpen your thinking, your critical analysis skills, your writing, broaden your worldview, etc.

So rather than agonize over the academic reputation of this place or that, or whether this place or that will ""get you a job"" (that has much more to do with getting an internship while you're in college and doing career-relevant volunteer work), pick a college that \*feels right\* to you. A place where you like the setting, a place you can afford without taking on insane amounts of debt, a place where the people feel like your people, where the kinds of student activities and organizations appeal to you, etc. College is going to cost your 4 years of your life. If you put effort into your experience there, you will get an absolutely top tier education at almost any top 100 university, as they are filled with top-tier brained people, for the most part. So don't sweat that part.","LPT: Don't worry about college rankings, except . . .",LifeProTips,False,1.0,1.0,1.0

thedrunkenrebel,t2_lkrc6mg,1647580385.0,"When i applied for a factory job i was told i will learn stuff on the go.

That's actually a massive red flag because it means:

1. Nobody can be bothered to teach new employees full procedures, either because they're not paid to aid others or because nobody actually knows the full process. When working in a factory there are so many processes and workflows and so many people responsible for their own part of these processes. Rarely a single person knows everything.

2. There aren't any theory resources to learn on your own besides actually doing it because the work hours are either stressful, the staff is burnt out, or there's only old staff with practically no worker turnaround, meaning everyone eventually learned their part and there's no longer any need to write manuals, for which the boss won't pay. Also, nobody made learning material for free, which means a bored and even toxic work environment where everyone does what's theirs and doesn't help their peers because they're not paid extra.

3. Months will pass before you'll eventually have a solid grasp on how to actually do all aspects of your job. You'll learn bits from everyone and figure new shit out daily, for too long before being able to fully understand how stuff should work and what are the priorities. Also, being the new guy in a staff of old people as mentioned before would mean everyone will ask you for help with anything to *teach you* but actually they'll use you to do their job.

If some company tells you you'll learn as you go, just get up and leave. Your job will be miserable and you'll be incompetent for months.

WillsWei22,t2_ce4mxwfv,1647574338.0,"With rising costs everywhere we look, many of us are trying to stretch our dollars as far as we can. With that said, I‚Äôm going to share some financial tips I discovered &amp; have utilized recently:

1. The average American is sitting on over $100 of unused gift cards/store credit. Gather up all the cards in your household &amp; do a balance check on them. Write down the value on each card &amp; come up with a plan to use them. Or you can sell unused/unwanted cards to site like CardCash or Raise for money!

Millennials are statistically the worst at making use of gift cards/store credit. Make sure you get on it!

2. Check your email inboxes for any e-gift cards you may have received over the years, but forgot about. Just search for ‚Äúgift card‚Äù at the top of your inbox &amp; see what comes up. Do a balance check on all the cards you find. Delete the ones with $0 so they‚Äôre out of the way &amp; plan to spend/sell those that do have a balance

This is kind of like finding money in your pants on laundry day. It‚Äôs a nice surprise &amp; every little bit helps

3. Call up your bank(s) &amp; credit card companies. Ask them if they can refund any fees (ATM or monthly service) &amp; interest charges

I did this with Wells Fargo &amp; got some money returned

Discover will refund 3 interest charges every 12 months, as well as some ATM fees. They can look at statements from as far back as 7 years to find/return a fee or interest charge

Just call your credit card company &amp; ask them to see what they are able to do for you!

4. Bring your coins to the bank (or local grocery store if they have a coin counter) &amp; exchange them for cash. Some of us are sitting on a lot of coins. I have a close friend who had almost $75 in coins he recently traded in. He used the money on his grocery bill that day. This is win-win as banks &amp; retailers are often short on coins these days

They will do this to make you sound terrible, when you were actually nice and not out of line at all, and they were the one who was actually mean and out of line.

I really wanted to start reading for years but couldn‚Äôt until I found the right book. I think the key is to think about your top three hobbies or interests then find short 200 or so page nonfiction books about those topics. Two of my favorite things are basketball and renewable energy/environmentalism so I tried a biography on my favorite basketball player and a book by David Attenborough that was half memoir on creating the nature documentary field and half about climate change. You‚Äôre obviously interested in those topics and reading about them is kind of like watching a documentary on your favorite thing but on steroids (along with relieving anxiety and exercising your brain) Once you get past those first couple books you will get better at it. Your attention span will lengthen and those nightly reading habits will develop in a way that will allow you to branch out into longer books about new topics. I hadn‚Äôt read a book since I was a kid then I tried this strategy when quarantine started and have read 45 books since then. It is definitely one of my top three hobbies now and looking at that pile of books Ive finished makes me so proud of myself.

I have been working for my current company for 4 years with a 6 month leave after the first 2 years (left to work at another company before getting an offer from my old manager). After returning to the company and receiving a substantial raise, I was forced to make an internal move and ended up accepting a pay cut, despite the new role being the same level and work being substantially more challenging.

That's what my friend who became a dentist asked me when I went to him for a second opinion. 

My old dentist retired and sold his practice to a young dentist. He bought all kinds of new equipment, including a Cerac machine and scanner for making crowns in the office. 

Lucky for me, I suddenly needed a crown!

Yet, for some reason, he didn't show me a photo of the damaged tooth. *cue the spidey senses*

I made an appointment with my friend who had bought his own practice. The dental assistant took some x-rays, he examined me, and asked ""What tooth supposedly needs a crown?""

I told him the general area and he said ""Dude, there's not even the start of a cavity there. No cracks. Nothing. Those teeth are 100% as perfect as can be for being almost fifty years old.""

Of course, Yelp removed the review I left for the old dentist where I stated that a Cerac machine sitting idle on the counter was not earning its keep. He also threatened to sue me for the wording of a few other phrases. 

Eventually, I replaced it with something like ""a Cerac machine is a very high tech Computer Aided Manufacturing machine capable of milling blocks of material into crowns for your teeth after the dentist produces a 3D scan. A dental lab that makes zero crowns in a month does not cost your dentist any money. The Cerac system probably costs more than your car. 

I do not know if the company allows the dentist to skip that month's payments if no patients need crowns, but that seems unlikely to me.""

A fair bit of that has been constructive but I've found a consistent amount has been more sabotaging. So some of the lessons I've learned are:

Don't let unfit people give you health advice. 
Don't let the lazy tell you what's worth effort. 
Don't let the stupid tell you what's smart.
Don't let the angry break your calm. 
Don't let losers tell you the game is rigged. 
Don't let the easily influenced, influence you. 
Don't let ideologues tell you what's right. 
Don't let philistines tell you what's aesthetic.
Don't let nihilists invalidate your meaning.  
Don't let addicts tell you can have ""just one"".

People who have been endured repeated failure will VERY often try to talk your achievements down. Your progress scares them and it's an instinctive attempt to make themselves feel better, not to help you.

Even if what someone opens up about hurts or upsets you, please be gentle and kind. The only reason they haven't said anything yet is because they were afraid. That doesn't necessarily mean they're afraid of you. They could be afraid of judgement, afraid of where you fit in with society (gender, religion, etc), or even afraid of being hurt. For most people, being afraid of something comes from trauma and experience.

When someone opens up to you, you have to think about how much courage they built up -- just to speak up. You have to realize that they are trusting you with the information you're given and are hoping you react in a way that proves you aren't like the others. They are trusting you with something valuable enough to make or break a relationship/bond. Their mic has been unplugged and they are praying that no one rips it out of its outlet again.

panic_in_church,t2_bfk8iues,1647450278.0,"When we think of self-care we usually think of bubble baths and disney movies in bed. Nah, screw that. Think about self-care in a preventative sense that will positively affect different aspects of your life. As someone who has been diagonsed with major depression and generalized anxiety disorder, this practices also has helped me heal from those issues and help fight back against executive dysfunction.

Without breaking the rules the best I can, here are some examples that have personally helped me a lot. Of course, always consult the professionals for advice and not some rando on the internet:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Find a PCP (Primary Care Provider), a therapist, a dentist, a chiropractor, and any other professional and visit them on a frequency as suggested by them that you are able. Just a consultation/check-up once can do a lot for you, if money/time is an issue. Use the appointment times wisely and ask them about ways to improve your health and quality of life. Catching problems now will help you so much in the future. (Example, I found out I had 3 cavities from just a one-time dentist checkup! We got them fixed way before I ever needed to get a root canal or the teeth removed.)
2. Have a consistent, restorative morning and night routine. This could consist of brushing your teeth, skincare, stretches, some sort of meditative practice, or anything else you want to incorporate to improve your quality of life. And most importantly, GET SLEEP.
3. Get a gym membership and go, even if you‚Äôre only doing 30 minute workouts‚Ä¶. or have a consistent home workout schedule. If you can, schedule a monthly massage (if there is anything you take away from this, GET MASSAGES). Your body is the only one you have and it‚Äôs best to take care of it.
4. Learn more about your finances and take care of your financial health. Make a budget. Get an emergency fund. Get a Roth IRA or equivalent and max it out each year. Check out places like Fidelity where you can do this but also get financial advising. Build healthy credit by opening a credit card, turning on autopay, and only putting low-cost subscriptions on it. Alot of self-care (in the US, anyways) unfortunately require money and you want to be able to afford it.
5. Remember that the quality of your life is more important than trying to ‚Äúlook cool‚Äù or ‚Äútough,‚Äù and it‚Äôs definitely a lot more important to spend money on the quality of your life than for example, a video game or new fashion. It‚Äôs not cool to brag about how much pain you are in. Trust me, you‚Äôre not getting a shiny medal for pulling your 3rd all-nighter in a row.
6. Do a consumption detox on a regular basis. What you consume will affect your quality of life. Dump toxic friends, resist the urge to doom scroll, and consume media that makes you happy, not miserable. Of course, stay informed about news and important things, but make sure you aren‚Äôt consumed by it.
7. Somewhat related to that, do your chores, as much as you and I hate them. Having a healthy and clean environment does wonders for your well-being.

With wages and inflation being as they are, some of these self-care practices are a lot harder to do for some (most) people financially. It‚Äôs also definitely harder for minors who are not independent yet and may be in toxic households(trust me, I‚Äôve been there). However, healthy habits everyday can still apply while being free. Remember that home workouts, mindfulness, journaling, budgeting, chores, friendships, etc. are all free.

Also as a disclaimer, this is not the magical fix for any problem and some problems require addressing  it directly first to improve your life (abusive relationships, as an example). This LPT is merely a way to \*improve\* yourself and your situation and give you a better chance at being happier. You deserve happiness regardless if you don‚Äôt do any of this or all of it.

1. Save your W2s, all of them, for at least 2 years.

2. Save your paystubs, but not any and all of them. Especially if you get commissions or overtime or bonuses, you will want to save the last paystub of the year that shows all the year-to-date earnings broken down by category. Also the last paystub at an employer. Also if you got an especially big commission/bonus/etc. At least 2 years' worth.

3. If you're self employed or 1099, keep your entire tax return, every single page, every single schedule. For at least 2 years, if not more. Most people will have digital copies but some people never get a digital copy from their accountants and they might have a hard time locating it for you or be ""too busy"" when you need them.

4. If you have any court orders that has to do with marriage/divorce/child support (going in and going out)/judgments/liens/bankruptcies/etc. save them indefinitely. ""Hey, you had this one lien/judgment on your record 10 years ago. Most likely gone now but we still need proof to triple check mmk?"" Is pretty common when you're trying to buy a house. Again. Every single page.

5. If you've owned/sold a home, documents pertaining to the purchase/sale of the home. Most people are good about keeping this but sometimes, if you were on the title for, let's say, your parents' house, and you weren't involved much in the sale, you might not have anything. But if you were on title, that means you might be asked for documentation for one reason or another. Same goes for title transfers like Quit Claim Deeds.

6. Proof of sale for cars, boats, other taxable vehicles. In case the new owner never does the proper paperwork and you end up owing taxes that turn into judgments for something you sold and now need to prove to remove the judgment.

7. Employment contract/offer letter/promotion letter if you change jobs and want to buy before you've established history at that new job. It's a hassle at some employers, to get that stuff again, especially in food service, construction, manufacturing, most blue collar jobs, small businesses etc.

These are all I can think of off the top of my head. Feel free to bring up more in the comments if you have personal experiences.

My answer was that I‚Äôd much rather work less often and get paid more than work more often and get paid less.

Charging daily got me paid the same amount if I worked a full 8 hours, or as often the case was, fucking around for 6 and getting everything finished in 2 (though, to be fair, there were seldom occasions where the work spanned more than 8 hours).

MO_drps_knwldg,t2_9ci33rgu,1647389326.0,"Until about four years ago, my previous positions were very analytical in nature and were centered around written reports and communication. I rarely had to verbally convey information to large groups.

When I took on a new position, I was required to be a cross-location meeting leader and primary presenter for a group of about 60 attendees. In addition, I was required to lead smaller weekly and bi-weekly calls

At first, this was nerve wracking, given my lack of speaking experience. What made the difference was focusing on the needs of my audience, rather than worrying about what their perception of me as presenter would be:

- Focus on providing a service to your audience, rather than being self focused.

- Know your material inside and out. If you have your material down, and speak to the audience instead of reading, you will already have achieved much of your objective

- Realize the audience isn‚Äôt judging you as much as you think. If you are engaging, they will be focused on the content and have questions or want additional information

I wish I had been forced out of my comfort zone earlier in life. The effect that consistent public speaking has had on my confidence can‚Äôt be overstated. When you are able to face one of the most intimating social circumstances on regular basis and excel, every day social interactions will not seem intimating.

Now, I‚Äôm ok with the 20% gratuity, but not on a bill that should have been lower. I called my bank and filed a dispute so the restaurant can reach out to me directly.

At a party while he was occupied cooking, instead of hanging by his side I made the (difficult) effort to branch off and go up to a group of women and asked if I could sit and join their chat. It was received so positively! I think it also relieved some of the pressure from my boyfriend to introduce me to people (although he is always great at making me feel comfortable when meeting new people)!

dochoiday,t2_79f5e,1647381750.0,"If you are bringing in your car to a dealership for service and repairs chances are you are getting ripped off. This applies primarily to Domestic and Japanese cars in the US. (Ford, Chevy, Toyota, Honda etc.) if you have European car your situation is a little different.

Your typical car dealership is going to charge 5-20% more for labor and parts as opposed to a local mechanic. On top of that they are more than likely to bill you for unnecessary things (although any mechanic will do this) like ""fluid Checks"" and ""tune ups"". These ""checks"" are total BS because you do not need to pay a mechanic to find issues on your car, they will do that for free (and often times its not broken). these are added in to make it seem like they are doing a lot of work and how they can get away with charging you $500 for a service that should really only cost $250. ""tune ups"" on the other hand are them spraying what is essentially a $5 can of sea foam in your air intake and billing you $50 for it. assuming they even do that.

(European car owners this doesn't necessary apply to you) However just because they are a ______ dealer doesn't mean they know how to work on the car better, this comes back to finding a trusted mechanic, If anything a good mechanic is going to do a much better job fixing your car than a dealership would.

The best thing to do is ask around/do a yelp or google search and find a well reviewed mechanic that has a reputation for being honest and doing good work. You want to look for the Jim's auto repair that your friend takes his car too and has 100's of legit positive reviews on google. You do not want to go to one of the large chains (Goodyear, Jiffy Lube, Mr. Tire, etc.) those places are whole different story of don't go.

As well don't be afraid to negotiate or say no. are they saying your brake fluid needs to be changed? probably BS. have you noticed your car is squealing like a banshee when you brake and they say you need new pad and rotors? probably true. a good way to negotiate as well is just to simply ask. They tell you its going to be $1,000 for that repair you need? just ask them what they can do for you on the price, worst they will tell you is no.

Finally, get a basic understanding of what your car needs. do not rely on the person billing you, telling you what needs to be done. your vehicles service intervals will be in your owners manual, refer to that as opposed to the dealership clerk.

If you own a European car, that's a much more difficult situation. Your best bet is to apply the above concepts just in hopes you can find a mechanic that can work on European cars without messing it up.

This was a lot of details but I hope it helps, in short the only work you should have done at a dealer is the work that's covered under warranty.","LPT, Unless it's covered under warranty, DO NOT bring your car to a dealership for service or repairs.
