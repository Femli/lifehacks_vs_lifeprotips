YouAreAGoodDogDug,t2_keydf0zo,1648702382.0,"There are several reasons why a bed could require changing during the night ‚Ä¶and it‚Äôs extra hard to do when you‚Äôve been yanked out of Dreamland.   There‚Äôs something you can do to make changing those sheets easy, no matter what the time!  Make the bed in layers that can be taken off to reveal clean sheets.  Here‚Äôs how:  Put a waterproof mattress pad down, make the bed as usual with sheets.  Add another waterproof mattress pad or waterproof pads and add another set off sheets.  When there‚Äôs a late night accident, you will simply remove the wet sheets and waterproof mattress pad and voila!  A clean, made bed, ready for using.  

If you want to make the bed, so that multiple accidents can happen without changing the sheets, consider buying one size larger sheet sets for the upper layers.  This will accommodate the extra size of the multiple sheet sets underneath them.  

For kids who provide wet spots consistently in the same place, consider using a draw sheet with doggy pee pads (unscented) underneath.  Place a doggy pee pad where the spot is expected then take a top sheet and fold it in half, lengthwise.  Put the folded sheet over the pee pad and tuck the sides in on both sides of the bed, so that the sheet is snug, keeping the pee pad in place.  Scotch tape can also be used to keep pads in place.",Changing Sheets at ‚ÄúWee‚Äù Hours of the Morning?,lifehacks,False,0.0,1.0,1.0

If you ever accidentally burn your finger(s) &amp;/or hand, grab yourself any type of rubber glove (improvise with cling wrap, etc. if need be), put the glove on your hand that's suffering from the burns, and get plain yellow mustard (if you don't have yellow mustard, ketchup can also work as a substitute) and squirt an excessive amount all on the inside of the glove to where it's saturated. Keep the glove on for upwards of an hour, and once you take it off, I can 100% guarantee that you will have no pain, no residual scarring, &amp; will be thanking me later.

A couple months back, my mom was over at my place, and I don't quite remember what she was doing, but some type of chemical liquid got too hot, and it poured out &amp; onto her fingers. She was in pain for around 20 minutes, trying everything from aloe vera, to ice, to cold water to sooth the burn, especially since the burn was starting to bubble up. After I realized nothing was working and she was thinking about maybe having to go to the ER, I remembered this hack I learned many years ago - needless to say, it literally saved her finger, stopped the pain, and prevented her finger(s) from being possibly disfigured &amp;/or scarred, &amp; from enduring 2nd/3rd degree burns.  My Mom likes to remind me often how if it wasn't for me and my mustard in a glove trick, that her finger would be f*ck#! off!

SrtDior,t2_b3th857f,1647942889.0,"I‚Äôm making this post because I want to hold myself accountable

I‚Äôm 23 years old currently working as a bouncer. I‚Äôve spent so much time working and I barely have anything to show for it. My life right now is literally smoking hella weed, gambling, partying taking girls on dates for drinks and occasionally some drugs.

It‚Äôs a fast lifestyle and sounds like a good time for anybody my age group but I couldn‚Äôt feel any emptier.

Yesterday I went out with a couple I met at my job and I took a girl on a date with me. The night consisted of throwing money at strippers at a huge strip club, drinking as much as we wanted too cuz  we got free bottles, the couple also brought some cocaine and MDMA so we indulged in a bit of that too.  And of course sex with this girl on hella drugs after 

Sounds like a good time right?
Wrong 
My mind felt like it was in a very dark place and I felt my vibration was super low something didn‚Äôt feel right at all.

I remember just driving home with my head hanging low and just feeling super defeated for some reason.

I think the reason is I know the potential I have for myself I‚Äôve been able to accomplish a lot and have really good jobs 

My problems all come with discipline, I have no balance when it comes to doing things. 
I‚Äôll get as high as I possibly can, I‚Äôll gamble all the money to my name, I‚Äôll not show up to jobs just because my mind feels a bit wrong

I‚Äôm done living like this I‚Äôm cutting out the small minded people out of my life and I‚Äôm getting selfish about investing in myself as much as I can in any way possible.

I come from the warmest sweetest parents you could ever meet. They raised me with such great morals, they represent hard work respect and loyalty.

My parents are getting older every single day they still both work Monday-Friday and im here barely working 3 days in the week. What the f*** kind of selfish bs is that. 

I see many people in my age group living like this and thinking it‚Äôs perfectly ok. That could never be f****ng me. God put me in this earth for a greater purpose than to just be self depleting myself all day and he blessed me with many great traits.

I have no excuses whatsoever. I‚Äôve had the pretty girls, I‚Äôve droven the dope cars, I‚Äôve met hella celebrities, I‚Äôve been to the best parties Miami has to offer.
Nothing makes me feel emptier every time than these temporary pleasures.

Real happiness to me is getting a workout, making myself a healthy meal, reading books, going out to the beach catching sunlight, accomplishing task that I know are gonna help me have a better tomorrow. Things like that have always made me not excited but fulfilled. True genuine happiness not dopamine from drugs

If your still reading anybody have some advice for me maybe? Regardless I‚Äôm making this change no matter what I‚Äôm tired of the lifestyle I‚Äôve been leading when I know the lifestyle I‚Äôm able to achieve.

Alexdandanalex,t2_1n8bzqoq,1647889643.0,"Hello, all! 

Almost all the music I've listened to since my adolescence were through sub-$10 checkout isle headphones. The main problems these headphones suffer from is cheap construction (tons of resonant space in the earphone itself/shotty connections) and excessive midrange (specifically the 500hz band).

Open the eq app on your phone/streaming platform and eq out the 500hz band by -15(ish)dB, and the 250hz and 1000hz bands by a quarter of that amount. Play around with the EQ to dial in the sound. I recommend using the aux in your car for reference. Switch between your headphones and the stereo and try to match the sound of the stereo EQ'd flat (all parameters at zero) to the sound of the headphones. 

This isn't going to make them sound like Sennheisers, but 5 minutes careful EQing can make a $5.00 pair of headphones sound like a $30.00 pair. When I was on a shoestring budget, that difference made my day a little nicer :). I've also heard of people stuffing the headphone cavity (the area behind the speakers) with cotton to nix most of the resonance. 

Hope this helps in a tiny way!",Simple way to considerably improve the sound quality of cheap headphones:,lifehacks,False,0.0,1.0,1.0

However, I hate the smell of bleach, and it usually takes a couple washes to get the bleach smell out. Usually I‚Äôll just rewash them on a speed cycle them with some vinegar afterwards to neutralize the smell. 

My water bill has been kind of high this month though, so I‚Äôm wondering if it‚Äôd be safe to wash them with bleach, but add vinegar to the fabric softener dispenser all in one wash. Obviously I know that bleach and vinegar can create toxic fumes, but the fabric softener gets released on the rinse cycle, so will it still create toxic fumes if I do that? 

It‚Äôs not like the bleach and the vinegar are gonna get directly mixed together because the bleach will get released during the wash cycle and the vinegar will get released during the rinse cycle.

closet_cheater,t2_769akocj,1647651807.0,"Hello r/lifehacks!

Being both completely sick of the shitty oligopolistic streaming sites ( @ Netflix &amp; Hulo ) and left with a few free hours without studying on hand, I developed [**Oligopoly**](https://olgply.com). Thought I'd share it with you wonderful humans in hopes that it'll help you guys out as much as it helped out a few friends of mine.

[Oligopoly (olgply.com)](https://olgply.com) is one of THOUSANDS of free streaming sites that has been infiltrating reddit lately. Contrary to other services, however, oligopoly attempted to reach a few goals others have yet to set.

These goals include but are not limited to:

* PWA ( progress web app ) functionality
   * able to install app on mobile device
* Modern user-interface
* Limited to AT MOST one ad per stream
   * funding comes out of own pocket
* Automatically update movies from [TMBD ( The Movie Database )](https://www.themoviedb.org/?language=en-US)
* Scrape streams from multiple sources.
* Completely Open-Sourced

Hopefully this project could satisfy at least a few people looking for something relatively refreshing. Tried my best to stray away from the copy and paste, heavily-monetized streaming sites you see already flooding the internet. Feel free to let me know how well I did with that.

&gt;**How is this possibly legal?**  
&gt;  
&gt;In the United States and EU member countries such as Germany and France, national copyright   
law prohibits the sale and uploading of unlicensed content. Thankfully, in our case, this content   
is not uploaded by us. Instead, third-party CDNs host and upload the content for us. My site   
automatically scrapes the internet for these out-of-jurisdiction networks and directly links to   
them on our site. As long as you refrain from downloading or torrenting media off our site, the   
only one the government has to blame is those naughty naughty third party CDNs.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**Should I be worried about my ISP?**  
&gt;  
&gt;You're streaming content, not seeding it. They could care less haha.

JetSetRadioFuture,t2_5x35z,1647275196.0,"I had frequent mold issues, since I don't go through cheese *all* that fast. 

All I changed was that I don't reach inside cheese packages or touch cheese I'm not going to eat.

Details:

\-Shredded cheese: Open and pour, never reach inside. Use clean spoon if pour is a no-go.

\-Block cheese: I wear gloves, or use a paper towel to touch the cheese block as I'm handling it. 

\-Sliced cheese: trickier, but can be done: bend the stack like a deck of cards to loosen desired # of slices. Then either use fork to extract, or fingers if you think you can do it w/o touching inside of plastic packaging. 

Since I changed my ways, I haven't had mold on cheese ever. It seems to dry out before it molds.   
(Your mileage may vary due to the types of mold spores in your air, which varies locally.)

&amp;#x200B;

I don't go through cheese super fast

Decided to try 'sterile' protocols to see what happened. 

No mold since then, amazingly.

Details: 

Do Not:

Touch cheese  
Reach inside cheese packaging  
Touch the inside of packaging surfaces

...that's it. Use forks or spoons to get at cheese if necessary.

jj4th,t2_g90o2,1647223865.0,"I see a lot of people saying they can't/won't use food delivery services because it's too expensive.  As a frequently flyer on food delivery apps I thought I could share a method I use to make it actually reasonable, time saving, and even healthy as well.  I'm not sure if my method will work for everyone (I'm single and live in a big city with a low cost of living and a lot of food choices), but perhaps there is someone out there who can benefit from my experience.

Long before COVID I used to work at home, with some pretty crazy hours that made it difficult for me to find the time to make meals beyond warming something in the microwave.  As the good book says, ""Man shall not live by frozen dinners alone,"" so when food delivery services became a thing I was interested.  At first it seemed too expensive, and potentially unhealthy... but I've figured out over time how to make it work, lose weight, save time, all without going broke.

If you find yourself without the time to make meals and your bank account is starting to whine in protest, perhaps something here will help.

I put this first because it's probably the biggest money saver overall.  Even if you just buy drinks at the grocery store (I'm a water drinker so I don't even do that), you will save SO MUCH MONEY not ordering drinks.  You're at home, no reason to order the expensive, marked up restaurant drink.

**Step 2: Leftovers/Split portions and Buy in Bulk**

If you're ordering a single meal for $10 with a $4 delivery and $6 tip that's $20 for one meal.  This is BAD.  Also that meal is probably 1100-1200 calories.  How I keep it reasonably healthy and save money overall is by ordering two meals, and then splitting them in half.  The delivery and tip usually don't change (or only by a dollar) for ordering more food.  $30 for four meals is MUCH better and more reasonable.

**Step 3: Lunch combos**

This is a small hack that can really push this method over the edge.  4 meals for $30 sound good?  Well if you can find a few restaurants that give reasonably sized lunch combos (chinese food and mexican food are great for this, but I also have an italian place near me that does the same thing) all of a sudden your 4 meals are costing $25, or less!  At this point it's often costing me less than fixing the same meal at home for myself.  Plus it gives you a natural split for more variety.  Have the enchiladas for lunch and the taco, rice and beans for dinner, etc...

**Step 4: Try different apps/Coupon clip**

Not all food delivery services charge the same for the same restaurant.  Obviously you're going to get the most bang for your buck if you can manage to stick to one service and leverage their monthly plan (heresy, I know, but it works out, I'll show the math at the end).  But often it's worth shopping other apps for one-time discounts, come-back coupons, etc... and just cheaper prices.

**Step 5: Shop close restaurants/Pickup when you can**

The delivery fees and suggested tips tend to be lower on closer trips.  To tie in to the above, a lot of these apps will even offer credit for placing a pickup order every once in a while and driving there yourself.  A $5 credit for pickup and not paying delivery/tip means the food cost less than if you had eaten at the restaurant.

Combining all these steps I've managed to average about $7.00 a meal for lunch and dinner (I usually just have a protein shake for breakfast and a banana or some strawberries).  When I was cooking all my own meals, it cost me about $6 a meal on average and I didn't have nearly the variety of food to choose from.

**TLDR:** I manage to pay about $7.00 a meal on average with food delivery by ordering multiple meals at once, splitting portions in half, buying lunch combos, nixxing the beverages, ordering from close restaraunts with low delivery fees, and coupon clipping.  This is about the same as when I was cooking for myself.",How to be financially responsible and still get your food delivered.,lifehacks,False,0.0,1.0,1.0

If you have travelled somewhere with just carry-on luggage and need to bring back more items than you brought but don‚Äôt want to buy an expensive suitcase (especially if you have one at home, you can use a [27-gallon tote](https://imgur.com/a/5k1WPk5) as your checked luggage. 

The dimensions of the tote is within the specs of most airlines. 

Additional tip; zip tie two or more of the holes and leave some zip ties on the inside on top of your items so TSA can re zip tie it

I do this all the time. My parents live in another city and I stay for months at a time and my luggage is inconsistent sometimes I bring them down tons of stuff. Sometimes the opposite so totes have become normal to me. They are more awkward to carry but they accommodate some items that a suitcase won‚Äôt. 

They really win when you don‚Äôt want to bring an empty suitcase down.

jbtuckr,t2_3wpjz70z,1646567925.0,"I work for a cell phone repair shop, I‚Äôve worked at numerous throughout the years. A lot of places use the cheapest parts they can get, even if it‚Äôs from a reputable supplier, so here‚Äôs my advice on the best way to get your phone/tablet fixed with the best quality. 

Apple doesn‚Äôt sell its parts to consumers, so third party manufacturers make their own parts or refurbish previously broken ones. Newer phones use OLED panels which are superior in every way to LCD (quality, efficiency, thinness, etc). There are LCD aftermarket options out now for iPhones, but they don‚Äôt look as good, they MURDER your battery, and they don‚Äôt exactly fit the phone perfectly since they‚Äôre thicker height wise. Most 3rd party places use LCD instead of oled for iPhone repairs, I‚Äôve worked for a place before that charged the premium and ensured people it was OLED but it was LCD, and it felt like a sin for every repair I had to do. 
What to do: get an account with MonileSentrix (the biggest wholesaler), or Injured Gadgets (a few dollars more than MS, but have had less defective screens sent to us than MS recently). Just make up a fake business name and put your home address, no business ever checks if you‚Äôre legit. Then just buy your own part and bring it in. Every place I‚Äôve worked at charges $35 if someone brings in their own part but doesn‚Äôt offer a warranty (if it‚Äôs defective, you just exchange it yourself). We charge $60-100 for labor on repairs where we use our own parts, lots of places charge higher for newer phones. 

The plus is you get to ensure your part is the quality you want, and the labor cost is cheaper. An added bonus is you get access to discounted cool ass accessories the sites offer, and a bonus is depending on the phone, you can get a battery with higher mAh than factory since battery technology is constantly improving

Also to note, injured gadgets has something called InsiredGadgets liquid glass which is basically a $300 repair warranty you can get for the wholesale price of $25. I don‚Äôt use a case bc I use it and I‚Äôve cracked and gotten reimbursed for 4+ devices. Totally worth it. You can order literally any part imaginable for your device, with the OEM options being more expensive, but always better. 3rd party repair shops are great, but it‚Äôs a business and they cut corners to make the most money. Not necessarily a bad thing unless they‚Äôre not upfront about it. Only thing you can‚Äôt replace yourself is the back glass, it requires a couple-thousand dollar machine and the only place to find glass with the apple logo on it is in obscure areas since it‚Äôs a trademarked logo.",Phone tablet repair: how to get premium quality at 3rd party shops,lifehacks,False,0.0,1.0,1.0

THEN We needed a power switch. There was already an electrical outlet under the sink for the dishwasher, but code says the dishwasher needed a dedicated line and the disposal needs a dedicated line.

That means going up into the attic, running new lines from the fusebox to the outlet that's already there, and connecting the dishwasher and disposal properly.

Electrician quoted me another $1,000 for that.

Now, I know it's not to code... but for $16 on Amazon, I have a working garbage disposal. ;)

SPon23567,t2_3x73kndk,1645957285.0,"all right this one's a bit of a doozy. it's a funky little thing that I discovered after buying a dragon fruit from the grocery store. apparently dragon fruit have this weird quality that allows them to absorb odor, something that I wasn't aware of until I bought one and put it right smack dab in the center of my fridge on the top rack. 

I kid you not there hasn't been a single odor coming from my fridge anywhere since I put this thing in my refrigerator. and normally there would be all kinds of smells like fruits and meats and milk 

it's so effective that I didn't even know that I had expired and moldy fruit and things in the drawers in my fridge. this is something that I remembered hearing about back when I was really young but I forgot. you can use certain types of fruits to absorb odors.

the way to do it is you go to the grocery you buy a dragon fruit a whole dragon fruit. skin and everything. don't cut it or pierce it, and place it roughly in the center of your refrigerator on the top rack as far forward as you can. you want to be able to see it because if it does start to rot you want to throw it out obviously. and then you just kind of leave the dragon fruit in your fridge. it apparently will just absorb the odors that would normally appear in a refrigerator. to a certain extent it will basically make your refrigerator odorless. I have had mine in the fridge for about a week and a half and I haven't smelled anything in the fridge, I'm literally known as""the guy that has the nose of a dog"" even my brother can't smell anything in the refrigerator and normally by now there'd be something. but no apparently it's just smells like there's nothing in there.

&amp;#x200B;

just a bit of an interesting tip for anyone who might want a cheap way to keep the refrigerator from stinking, or if you have something that's very stinky that you want to put in your fridge if you put a dragon fruit next to it there's a chance that it could absorb a lot of the odor.",how to get rid of those annoying smells in your fridge...,lifehacks,False,0.0,1.0,1.0

Have you ever felt a pain that is annoying and you would like to be gone? Hit your toe on the table? Got something in your eye that causes it to hurt every time you blink? A needle stuck under your finger perhaps? Fallen down and hit your dominant arm really hard? Someone said a mean word? Did someone say the N-word and now you can't physically work? Your parental figure forcefully hugged you? Girlfriend broke up perhaps? Your parents disapprove of your sexuality or your new 5th gender?

Do not worry! Because the solution is here! By following my simple and easy to follow 5 step life hack I can teach you how to effectively deal with pain!

Step 1. Have a pain that you want to be moved.

Step 2. Pick a body part where you don't feel any pain. 

Step 3. Utilize tools, hands or body part.

Step 4. Relocate pain to choose body part by applying more pain to the new location than the old location.

Step 5. Pain is now relocated to a different area and you no longer feel any pain from your original area.

But later last year i realised  i made a huge mistake and then then i tried to Convinced  her a lot to back Again. i apologised  to her everyday for a month. Her friends  knows How  much i cried. But she said she cant be back. She said she wants a relationship  less simple  life and doesn‚Äôt  feel the same about me! I said be friends then, but she she said it also not possible. She said seeing  my texts makes her sad and she  can't  focus on anything  after that i stopped  convincing  her again!

But recently  i talked to her closest friend,  whom she(my ex) share everything. Her friend told me we might  have a chance to  get  back together. When i asked her why does she think so, she said she doesn‚Äôt  know, she just felt that. My Ex's friend  said she sometimes thinks about me but then regret  it. She is actually  confused  Whether  i am the right  person or not. But she did forgive me for what i did.

But my problem  is i am thinking  about her a lot. Everytime  i see her makes me so sad. It's  been 5 months  since i broke  up, part  of me feels she Will  never  comeback ,  but i still cant overcome  her

What to do now? Am i acting as  a loser? Or is it normal! These relationship things are new to me &amp; she is my first love.  I dont  want to be in relationship  with any other girl except  herself!

logantauranga,t2_35osh,1645476079.0,"Dan Pink has done a lot of work to reduce complex ideas down to simple 1-2 minute videos, but his titles are clickbait-y and his guests invent buzzwords to sell their books. I've summarized each of these down from his videos.  

These are listed by Pinkcast video number, so to read more click this [link to the videos and source info.](https://www.danpink.com/pinkcast/)
  
1.1 When stuck, ask 'what would you tell your best friend to do?'
  
1.2 Each day, write down then do your Most Important Task before the noise of work can get in the way.
  
1.3. When stuck, use a sounding board (rubber duck) to talk through a process/problem.
  
1.4 A parent/boss should be both supportive and demanding, it's not zero-sum.
  
1.5 Dan likes a specific pencil.
  
1.6. Do a 'premortem' to anticipate pitfalls and write out positive practices that will avoid each one.
  
1.7 When deciding to do something or not: if it's not a 'hell yes' then it's a no.
  
1.8 If you can do the next step on something within 2 minutes, it's best to do it now.
  
1.9 Instead of positive affirmations, ask yourself questions to reflect on your plan.
  
1.10 If you know 'the 1%' abstract/summary, it will help you contextualise a whole body of work.
  
1.11 Instead of planning, start by doing. Prototype, volunteer, fail in a low-stakes way. Then begin your plan.
  
1.12 Starting writing down failures and what you learned. It's data to help you stop repeating mistakes.
  
1.13 Set up an hourly beep on your phone. Take a breath, reset to your top priority.
  
1.14 Use an 'empty chair' to periodically remind yourself to think of user/reader/customer needs.
  
1.15 Your life will feel more meaningful if you regularly go out of your way to do nice things for people.
  
1.16 As well as a To Do list, keep a 'To Don't' list (things to avoid) and a 'Done' list (what you completed).
  
1.17 Saying ""I don't"" is more effective than saying ""I can't"" because it describes a principle.
  
1.18 Get your staff to write the company's purpose on a card. Most will cluster. The rest will learn.
  
1.19 The person with the biggest screw-up story wins a Stuffed Monkey for that week; this changes culture.
  
1.20 Gifts (abilities) + Passions (interests) + Values (good workplace/role) = Calling (what gets you out of bed).
  
1.21 Six career tips: (1) plans fail, (2) enjoy using your strengths, (3) get ahead by focusing on the work, (4) persistence is more important than talent, (5) if you aim high, failure is OK, (6) cause meaningful change.
  
2.1 The placebo effect of 'lucky' items can actually help.
  
2.2 Take handwritten notes because it's slower and you're forced to summarise rather than transcribe.
  
2.3 Keep things in a drawer that make you feel nice like family photos/thank-you notes/etc for when you need a boost.
  
2.4 Get perspective on something upsetting by imagining you're looking back at it 1 day/week/year later.
  
2.5 Don't jump to solution-ing right away. Dwell within the problem space for a while and re-examine your initial questions.
  
2.6 Repeat of 1.18.
  
2.7 Talk less about 'how' to implement stuff, and more about 'why' you do stuff, to keep your focus and motivation.
  
2.8 Get emotional distance from jerks by pretending to be scientist who studies jerks and has found a specimen.
  
2.9 It's better to give bad news first because the good news at the end makes it seem like things are getting better.
  
2.10 Ask people what gift they want and give them that.
  
2.11 Start diets on Mondays because it feels like a fresh start. He lists 34 other days that are also good.
  
2.12 Networking is much easier if you reconnect with established contacts rather than reaching out to strangers.
  
2.13 To perform better, hyper-focus on 2-3 things and go all-in to get every little detail right.
  
2.14 Morning exercise for weight loss, mood boost, and establishing a routine. Evening exercise for enjoyment, performance, and avoiding injury.
  
2.15 Drink coffee an hour after getting up and also before/after a short nap.
  
2.16 Before giving feedback, tell people you have high expectations and believe they can meet those expectations.
  
2.17 Set 25 goals for your life. Choose the top five and ignore the other 20 until those five are achieved.
  
2.18 When you're nervous, tell yourself you're actually excited. They feel similar except one is positive.
  
2.19 After you master your job and don't feel like you're learning anything new, it's time to change roles/companies.
  
2.20 When cold-emailing, respect someone's time, have very specific questions, and keep your ask small and easy.
  
2.21 Take breaks. Go for a walk, or have social contact, or go outside. Don't do work stuff or phone stuff.
  
2.22 If you use self-talk for motivation, use your name instead of 'I'.
  
2.23 You can use Pixar's six-sentence structure to easily easily frame an idea/pitch as a story that feels compelling.
  
2.24 Dan does weird things with hotel room stuff.
  
2.25 Be very specific when you ask for help. Ask in person. Make sure it's the right person to ask.

Well, I found a method to help prevent this (it‚Äôs not 100% perfect, nor will it always apply. For example, if you‚Äôre on a crowded bus and don‚Äôt have the foot room), and I hope it helps.

Number one; don‚Äôt lock your knees, have your knees slightly bent. Not only does it make your joints hurt in the long run, but it‚Äôs more rigid, so you can‚Äôt fight against or adjust to the force of the bus‚Äôs movement. And number two, feet at shoulder width. With a wider stance, you‚Äôre able to have a more stable base. With these two steps in mind, you can adjust far more easily, adjustments being far easier due to your unlocked knees, and be far less likely to bowl over. I do this when I‚Äôm on the bus (college student), and I‚Äôm even able to stand without grabbing something, it works so well a majority of the time. That‚Äôs just me, though.

A kidney stone is a mineral deposit built up in the urinal, and there is only one way to get it out. It has to pass through the urethra. This is painful.

Labor pain is comparable to this pain.

Symptoms of kidney stones include severe pain in the side, or a burning sensation while urinating. This pain increases rapidly and then disappears immediately.

The locksmith took pity and the fact that I had to pay him every visit, I was practically helping him make a living. He actually made me write my door key# in a discreet place (split into two places) so i could get the key made for $15 instead of $100, which is what a call to him would have cost me.

Anyway I finally figured out a way to stop that from happening. My issue was that I usually have stuff in my hands, carrying things or doing things and tended to put the keys into my pockets if I was wearing pants, or purse if it was with me. If i had neither I would set it down somewhere and that would be the last I saw of it.

Reason being that it gets lonely being a single child. It's kind of made me start to consider the idea. But I feel it's kind of selfish for me to have another kid that I can't give everything that I want to.

If your ass makes noise, then thats still going to reverberate. This does not solve this issue, but merely the water issue.

Whether you drop a rock solid mega-duece 5000, or piss fire from your ass, this will make it so it doesn't make a loud sound when it hits the water.

Step 1: You unravel some toilet paper.

Step 2: You place the toilet paper inside the water and lay it flat. You may want to layer it depending on how you feel the velocity of your shit will release.

Step 3: Take your shit. IN SILENCE. No longer feel embarassed in public restrooms. You have ascended.

Danielnrg,t2_eb4za,1645244952.0,"The conventional wisdom is to spend at least 2 months of your annual salary on an engagement ring. So, if you're making $60,000 a year, your engagement ring should cost at least $10,000.

However, if you get engaged young and before you've found a good career, you can save soooo much on engagement rings. In 2019 I made $15,000 working at a movie theater. If I'd gotten engaged then, I'd only have to pay $2,500 for an engagement ring! 

The best part is, whoever you're getting engaged to will agree to get engaged as long as you spend two months worth of salary! It doesn't matter how much your salary is. If I'd gotten engaged when I was fresh out of high school and didn't have a job, she would've had to give ME money to pay for the ring!

FlowMeTheMoney,t2_721bkwnu,1645109383.0,"Disclaimer: This is not a ‚Äúhack‚Äù to freely use more data than you pay for every every single month back to back. It‚Äôs more for in case you‚Äôve used all your data and you‚Äôre stranded and you ended up using Google Maps way too much (i.e. me) or you genuinely just forget to turn it off. Also a teeny lie is involved but Canadian cell phone providers charge up the ass anyways.

Anyways, I‚Äôve been with three separate Canadian cellphone providers and prior to hitting my data cap I always get a text saying, ‚ÄúYou have reached 90% of your data usage.‚Äù 

In the case I have not turned my data off past this point, I‚Äôll get another text saying, ‚ÄúThere is $50 data overage charges on your bill‚Äù-blah blah legally can‚Äôt go over $50 etc.

All you have to do is:

1. Call your service provider.

2. Tell them, ‚ÄúI usually receive a text saying I have reached 90% data usage and I turn my data off based on the text. I didn‚Äôt receive any text this time around and my bill is way too high.‚Äù

If they say they‚Äôre going to escalate it, or investigate, just say you‚Äôve been a loyal customer and will switch providers if this is not waived. Keep in mind the service representative DOES have the authority to waive charges, so there is no need for escalation.

3. The service representative at this point will just waive the charges. One or two times of saying you will switch providers usually works - keeping old customers is cheaper than finding new ones.

I have used this personally four times with my current provider, but due to times I genuinely needed data.",How to Get Data Overage Charges Waived,lifehacks,False,4.0,1.0,1.0

1 Not stripped fairly regularly (releases trapped yuk as they're designed to trap yuk)
2 Washed with fabric softener (absorbency loss)
3 Dried with dryer sheets (absorbency loss)

Vacuum areas (around/on toilets, etc.) before cleaning with microfiber to avoid the awful fuzz &amp; hair that won't rinse out.

Color code the cloths with their use, such as orange for furniture polishing, green for kitchen,  yellow for toilets/blue for the rest of the bathroom... 

With glass, use one cloth (damp) for spraying and wiping window cleaner and another (dry) one for buffing. 

Plan on using several in the house cleaning process, they are faster, better &amp; less expensive than paper towels.

It all started when I was washing one bottle that had been stored on top of the fridge for some time. The bottle was caked in kitchen grease (I live in a very old house in LA with 3 rando roommates so we all inherited this nastiness when we moved in)

Soap and water never work on whatever this gross stuff is

I thought to try grape seed oil. Poured some in a small tray and used a brush. The grime came right off. I then washed with soap and water and voila! The glass bottle wasn‚Äôt sticky or dirty anymore. 

Ecstatic I thought, ‚Äúthis must be a thing,‚Äù and proceeded to wipe down the entire top surface of the fridge nd stove with grape seed oil, then take a soapy sponge and wipe down again.

I was surprised when I googled grapeseed oil and this wasn‚Äôt as much of a ‚Äúthing‚Äù as I thought. I ultimately used soap and water to clean so I‚Äôm pretty sure that I made the kitchen safer by removing the caked on grease, but wondering if anyone can inform from their knowledge or experience?

* The first (or last) *x* letters of the service
* The number of letters of the service
* The name of the service spelled backwards
* The digit above each letter of the service on a QWERTY keyboard (e.g. `Reddit` -&gt; `433385`)

As a completely fabricated example, you can improve the password `correct horse battery staple` (xkcd's example of a secure password) by adding a few of these.

Next time you have hiccups, grab a pencil or pen and shove in between your upper and lower teeth. So basically gently bite down on the pencil or pen.

As you're still biting down on it, grab a big glass of water (as cold as possible) and stand over a sink preferably if you can. And just chug that water down with the pencil between your teeth. It'll feel unnatural but pretend it's not there and concentrate on glugging down the water.

Keep doing it until you've finished the entire glass and I guarantee the hiccups are gone. I legit only discovered this a few weeks ago

Bonus tip but I've only tried it once tonight so it may be a fluke but I had hiccups and couldn't be bothered to get up and get water so I put my finger in between my teeth like a fake version of the above and started gasping air between my finger like a fuckin loser and the hiccups are gone lolol bye",Hiccups.,lifehacks,False,6.0,1.0,1.0

# How To Work On Yourself

### Your guide to become the best version of yourself

The best journey you'll ever experience is the journey of self improvement when you make a decision to reach your highest self and become the greatest version of you,only then you can commit to whatever it needs to be done.you just need to believe that your hard work will pay off.  


#### Here are 8 things you need to do when you're working on yourself:

### 1-Recognize your toxic traits

no one is perfect ,we all have issues and toxic traits that most of us don't even recognize because we are deeply involved in only confronting the best picture of us and hiding our worst,though,by doing this,we are suppressing our true identity and nature,thus we can never be able to be ourselves or experience life properly.  


### 2-Eliminate the barriers inside your mind

our thoughts are not the reality,we can never see reality as it is until we clean our vision by eliminating the thoughts and beliefs that keeps us away from seeing true life and moving forward.these barriers are self-made and are only meant to obstruct our sight ,so we need identify them and work on getting rid of them.  


### 3-Build trust within yourself

this only can happen when you feel safety and peace within you,trusting yourself includes listening to your inner voice and believing it,trusting your plans and believing in you when no one else¬† does.this builds a strong bond with yourself that allows you to become decisive about your next step and move more smoothly towards what you desire.  


### 4-Visualize your goals

everything imagineable or the mind can think of,can easily happen in real life,thus,you can start visualizing your goals with every little detail¬† as if they are truly happening right now.through this process,our conscious mind is convinced that your specific goals will most likely happen,at the same time,it strenghtens your beliefs about the possibility of it happening.you just need to work on it as if it's already yours.  


### 5-Leave your comfort zone

no improvement can come from staying in your comfort zone,on the contrary,our comfort zones are the primary cause of our stagnation in life,because it hinders us from taking a leap towards doing something that might completely change us and our life.our comfort zone may be an activity,a thought or a habit,and sometimes we don't even notice it,until we look closely.  


### 6-Stay curious

life is all about asking new questions everyday,and the process of looking for the answers is your lifelong journey.so make sure to open your mind to acquiring knowledge everyday from inside and outside you.curiosity is an exercice for the mind¬† that helps connecting us with limitless answers,and thus,shapes us to become exactly what we're destined to be.you should first work on answering the questions about the inner you in order to open the door for answering questions about¬† what's outside¬† you.  


### 7-Seek permanent pleasures

never put extraordinary effort on temporary life pleasure that won't benefit you in the long run,instead plan ahead and let your present actions match your plans for the future and the type of life you're seeking.  


### 8-Be responsible for your life

pick wisely your life choices because the smallest decision can push you forward or backward that's in your hands.try to seek more what benefit you in terms of improvement,learning and pleasure,and¬†make sure that the choices you make are a reflection of your ambitions and goals and what you're preparing for your future,meanwhile,avoid everything that distracts you from setting your mind on that goal.  


### Conclusion

there is only one person responsible for the quality of your life and that person is you,your true life will only begin when you start acting according to your life's purpose,so bear in mind that your life depends on you ,and there will always be work for you to do if you want to keep moving in life.

Posting photos of our wooden cabinets that have horrible looking stains on them after a cleaning service we never used before did a deep clean on our house. I wasn't home so I don't know what they used. There is now harsh white streaking that won't come off, anyone have any idea what caused these stains and what do I use to get it off? Be as specific as possible, I know nothing about cleaning wood (which is why I hired a service).
*NOTE: I already tried a damp (not wet) rag with mild dish soap on one area and it did absolutely nothing to the streaks. Does this mean they are actually scratches/discoloration ingrained in the wood as opposed to residue sitting on top?

Step 1: Press ctrl+shift+i to enter inspect element mode

Step 2: Click the box at the top left corner of the inspect element box, then click the nickname element

Step 3: You should see a bit of text highlighted in the element tab now. Find the thing that says 'maxlength' and change the value from 15 to any large number you want

Step 4: Go back to the nickname tab and you should be able to make your name as long as you want!

[There you go! Now all your friends and teachers can laugh at your extremely long name. Maybe not the teachers.](https://preview.redd.it/jm9qpf0uc9g81.png?width=1264&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a305bd7f94a90f455512d06b61ece414a2f5fcf4)

But flatypus! My teacher turned on the friendly nickname generator! Whatever could we do? Well, you're in luck, because some genius found a way to bypass that too!

1. First, you want the [redirector extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/redirector/ocgpenflpmgnfapjedencafcfakcekcd), found here. (I'm not affiliated with them in any way, but the source code is public [here](https://github.com/einaregilsson/Redirector) for any coders.)
2. Next, visit [here](https://easrng.github.io/kahoot-namerator-bypass/), the kahoot name bypass website; all it does is generate a json file that you import into the redirector. (If you're skeptical about this website too, don't fret; its also available on github [here](https://github.com/easrng/kahoot-namerator-bypass).)
3. Open the extension by clicking the extension button at the top right corner of your browser, and click 'edit redirects'.
4. Click 'import redirects' and import the .json file you got from the bypass website.

Now, whenever you join a kahoot that uses the friendly name generator, the redirector will automatically change the name to the name YOU want!

(note, since this uses some API thing, don't use names over like 1000 characters; it just breaks the website lol.)

Hope this was helpful!

# HOW TO STOP OVERTHINKING

Overthinking is simply the act of thinking about something too much or for too long. it is also a state of mind when the mind is ruminating on thoughts,past/future events,ideas...etc which will lead to creating a loop of worries,stress and anxiety.Generally overthinking is caused by the person's inner struggles like fear,lack of self worth,self doubt and low self esteem.  
**Here are tips to help you get rid of overthinking habits:**  


### 1-Be aware of your thoughts

pay attention to your thoughts pattern because this will make you gain control over it,try to identify each thought and trace it back to the moment of its creation.then ask and answer yourself honestly about why and how you are thinking this way.mostly,it is deeply related to your limited beliefs and inner struggles.  


### 2-Let go of what you can't control

examine your thoughts and suurender to the fact that you have no control over certain things,so worrying and overanalysing it wouldn't change the situation.instead, focus on what you can control or change at the present moment and take immediate action afterwards.  


### 3-Focus on the solution

begin to shift your attention to finding a solution rather than just keep ruminating the situation in your mind.this will change your perspective about facing triggering situations or problems and save your time and energy.  


### 4-Eliminate ""what if's""

you should deeply believe that things work by a divine plan that you can't see right away,whether you're overthinking past or future events,if you're wondering if you have acted differently maybe things would've been better now,then the only thing you can do now is trust that whatever happened was meant to be.however for future events,all you can do ""now"" is take action and believe that whatever would¬† happen tomorrow is meant to be too..  


### 5-You attract what you think

our mind is more powerful than we might think,so if you are thinking positively about a future event and imagining all what could go right rather than what could go wrong,you are embodying your imagination in real life and spreading positive energy inside and outside you which would send your mind signals to attract the same energy in your reality.so the image you expose to your mind is so important as the mind can turn imagination to reality.  


### 6-Stay present

when you don't have control over your mind,your thoughts would run loose non stop which may even extend to complicating unrelated matters of the past or future and creating problems which will put you in a state of intense worries.all you you need to do is concentrate on your present moment and be conscious on the ""today"",neither yesterday nor tomorrow .  


### 7-Right-size the problem

somethings are more worthy of obsessing over than others,so you got to carefully choose which situation is worth devoting your time and energy for and which one isn't,this will lessen the pressure on you and protect your peace of mind.  


### Conclusion

there two things you should know : if you control your mind and use it wisely and properly,you will be able to control your life ,the second thing is that everything handled ""overly"" like OVER-thinking,OVER-working,OVER-planning...etc,is not healthy and affects our life in a negative way.

My idea for this list is to help me focus on how to seem confident, trustworthy and professional, maybe it'll help you too. For some extra pictures from the movie, check out the link above...

Principles

**1. Relaxed body language**

WHY: It helps other people feel relaxed too and builds up your confidence.

HOW: Spread yourself out comfortably. Move yourself freely. Have eye contact on special occasions.

**2. Be non-reactive**

WHY: If you are non-reactive it shows you are not pressured by what‚Äôs happening around and have all the control.

HOW: Simply don‚Äôt react, stay silent under pressure. Pause and breathe.

**3. Don't try to convince other people**

WHY: It helps you be persuasive.

HOW: Frame yourself as an equal partner, be willing to walk away.

**4. Signal good health**

WHY: A healthy body carries a healthy mind.

HOW: Keep your back straight, posture upright and radiate positive energy. Try to smile.

**5. Believe that you will be ok**

WHY: This helps you tell the truth. You will stop worrying about rejection, and will never be weak.

HOW: Live it and be practical.

**6. Make your clients believe in you**

WHY: How much would you trust being on a plane with a first-time pilot? What about being on the table of a first-time brain surgeon?

HOW: Emit competence. Make decisions swiftly and act firmly. Don‚Äôt hesitate. Avoid showing weakness.

On average, people urinate between 6 ‚Äì 7 in a 24 hour period. So we call that 6.5 X per day on average.  Depending on the plumbing in the erection (I mean a *building*, not the other kind of erection!), it usually takes 10-30 seconds for the hot water to reach the faucet.  So we can use 20 seconds as a rough estimate. 

6.5 uninations per day X 365.25 days per year X 20 seconds of waiting for the water to get hot each time = 47,450 seconds, or 790.83 minutes I'll save every year using this method.

\- Through my insurance I had a fitness program that let me join a ton of gyms for $30 a month. I think that's logical. In 2022 my job changed insurances and I lost that benefit.

\- New insurance doesn't have that benefit. We do have this LifeMart thing or something like that where there's an ""Active Fit"" subscription but the options are crappy and much more limited.

So now I'm trying to figure out if there's any other ways to get gym memberships. I started looking at Credit Cards perks to see if any are offering something like that.

_re_cursion_,t2_nlif8,1643604278.0,"Tired of being the ""crazy uncle"" or the ""whack job cousin"" at family gatherings? Done with being the ""lunatic fringe"" at parties? Don't like being fooled into falling for conspiracy-theory based scams? Exhausted with how your ideas keep shifting as you accept new conspiracy theories and reject old ones? Tired of alienating all your friends with crackpot ideas?

I have a method that might help you. I was born somewhat vulnerable to that sort of thing, but I've been working on upping my resistance to it for over 15 years. Now, I'm one of the LEAST conspiracy-minded people I've ever met. If you're like me, the key is using innate rigidity to counter it. You don't necessarily have to do this part, it's optional, but: In my case, I stopped accepting ANYTHING where concrete physical, logical, or mathematical proof doesn't exist. Yes, this means I had to abandon religion; that was sort of the ""crack"" in my mind that allowed all the weird stuff to get in. I also had to reject any form of supernatural beliefs wholesale; that was another huge vulnerability which led to all sorts of junk thoughts/ideas.

Then, implement a series of criteria (they work best if you choose not to believe in anything supernatural/religious period, like I did  - but they MAY still work if you don't, I just won't make any guarantees) for all ideas/conspiracy theories presented to me:

1. Profit test: Is there a concrete profit motive - a real reason why the purported culprit(s) would benefit financially or personally from taking part in the scheme?

2. Possibility test: Can it be explained by science - is there a known physical, real mechanism accepted by the scientific community  by which it could be done? (no supernatural crap allowed - this test is really important)

3. Incompetence test: Could it be done by a real group of people? Imagine, for a moment, that the supposed conspirators were replaced by people you know in real life - would they be able to do it?

4. Group size test: Does it AVOID requiring a large number of people to keep a secret? (large groups are incredibly leaky / suck at keeping secrets)

5. Adverse motive test: Is it IMPOSSIBLE that the person telling you the theory would benefit in any way from you/people believing in it? (if they could benefit from lying to you about it, they probably _are_ lying)

6. Source test: Does it come from a source which is respected and known to be reliable? Do they have any legitimate, provable credentials that could explain how they found out about it? Does anyone respectable trust them?

7. Efficiency test: If the theory includes a more efficient/cheaper way of doing something, are businesses/corporations using that method on a large scale? (eg: water dowsing would DEFINITELY be used by corporations IF it worked, because it would be so much cheaper - but they don't use it, which is good evidence it doesn't work; cold fusion clearly doesn't work otherwise we'd definitely be using it for power already to solve climate change)

8. Dependency test: If the theory were true, would everything we do in the modern world still be possible? (example: the world CANNOT be flat because ships and planes fly around the world on a pretty regular basis, and satellites can be seen orbiting; also, gravity would be partly sideways on a disc world, which it clearly isn't - and, to cap it off, astronauts and ALL trustworthy field experts KNOW the world is round.)

9. Secrecy test: If the thing is supposedly secret, is there actually a concrete reason why they would actually benefit from / need to keep the thing secret - and if there is, is it even possible for someone to find out? (if someone is claiming to be the discoverer/whistleblower, see test 6 again)

10. Internal consistency test: Does every part of the theory/idea agree/work with everything else it says? Is the story entirely consistent? Does the story stay exactly the same when you ask questions or talk about it again later? (eg: if someone tells you that the moon landing didn't happen because the government is lizards, but the next time you ask they say it's because the government is horse people, then you know they're probably feeding you a load of crap)

11. Occam's Razor test: Is it the simplest explanation, and does it best satisfy the above criteria out of all the possible options? (if it isn't or it doesn't, it's probably not true)

If the answer to ANY ONE or TWO of the above tests is NO, then whatever they're trying to tell you has a 90% chance of being complete bulls***. If the answer to THREE OR MORE of the above tests is NO, then whatever they're trying to tell you is DEFINITELY complete bulls\*\*\*.

ONLY if the answer to ALL the tests is YES, should you really consider the possibility that what you're being told MIGHT be true. It COULD still be bulls\*\*\*, but if it passes all the tests, the odds are _much_ lower.

If you strictly apply this method, you won't fall for bulls\*\*\* and you might even gain a reputation amongst your friends for being down-to-earth and having reliable information.",Falling for BS conspiracy theories on a regular basis? Try this.,lifehacks,False,0.0,1.0,1.0

Finally, spin your corn like a log roll directly on the stick of butter, moving left and right as needed to cover the length of the cob.

shankey_1906,t2_1lvoywjq,1643498447.0,"If you are working on your keyboard all day, you can get a significantly better typing experience by using few simple lifehacks with minimal $. 

1. If you use a keyboard whose height is not to your liking, just add some cabinet door bumpers to the bottom of your keyboard. The sticky side ensures they stick to your keyboard properly and the squishy side ensures your keyboard has a firm grip on the desk. You can get a 100 pack for a few dollars. 
2. Some keyboards are way too small (magic keyboard) which is not too ergonomic if you use it alone with a wrist rest. The height of a single cabinet bumper might not be enough, in which case you can use it along with double side tape which are usually \~2 or so mm thick. Use multiple layers to get the desired height and add a cabinet door stopper at the end. You can use this method to also change the angle of the keyboard. 

Both of these combined are less than 10 dollars and might upgrade your typing experience without upgrading hardware.

I'm 30, moving alone, and don't have ""alot"" to bring. I will be buying new furniture/TVs &amp; all that once I get out there. The stuff I need to bring now is basically 2 large suitcases of my clothes, a large office desk, workout equipment &amp; some other medium sized heavy items. Since these won't all fit in my Ford Focus, and I was planning to drive out for the move, I was considering 2 options:

1. Rent Uhaul van &amp; trailer (with my car on trailer), drive out &amp; drop the stuff back at a Utah Uhaul location. I liked this because once I get there, I'll want the Uhaul truck to pick up mattress &amp; couches same day before bringing it to Uhaul for drop off. Anybody tried this?
2. Pack what I can in my Ford Focus &amp; ship the rest (at least 2-3 bulky 50lbs+ items)

digdug78,t2_o9prv,1643461506.0,"Large plastic soda bottles are much cheaper than smaller ones per volume, but they have the problem of losing the carbonation if not consumed quickly.

There are a number of known hacks (immediately empty the large bottle into smaller glass bottles for future consumption, keep it stored cold and upright with a tight lid ) , and some which even appear to be myths (squeeze out the leftover air of the bottle, or use a air pressure pump)

I've come up with an extra trick which I haven't seen online, and thought I'd share... it goes as follows:

Once your bottle is starting to go flat, open a new one. After pouring a glass, top up the new bottle with the flattish Coke so that it is full again. This works well for me because brand new large bottles are usually very fizzy, and diluting it a bit is not a problem. Leaving the bottle full means the bottle loses less fizz while storing it as there isn't much room for the carbonation to escape into. When reopening the bottle days later there isn't such a loud fizz sound (meaning not much CO2 leaves the bottle on opening, yet the Coke remains nice and fizzy).

I use this way when dicing up onions and tomatoes and such and decided to use it with garlic tonight and my life has been forever changed!! 

Basically, you cut lines leaving a little bit of space at the top to keep the clove together, at your desired thickness, then flip it to it's side that you haven't cut and cut that down the center still leaving room at the top. From there, go to the end of the clove that's been cut and chop towards the top... BAM QUICK AND EASY DICED GARLIC.

So I saw that [Crypto.com](https://crypto.com/) offers free Spotify Premium for their users and here is my review to this:  
Here you can find where they mention the free spotify: [https://crypto.com/eea/cards](https://crypto.com/eea/cards)

Shortly about the company:  
Crypto.com offers Visa debit cards that give 2% cashback for every payment. Recently [they started a huge ad campaign starring Matt Damon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hBC5TVdYT8) and they [bought the naming rights to the Staples Center in L.A. for 20 years](https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2021-11-16/crypto-staples). Next to the cashback of 2% they also offer free Spotify.

They have different options of Debit Cards. The Ruby Steel card tier offers a **$25 instant bonus, free Spotify and 2% cashback on all purchases,** and a metal card. To get the card you need to stake ‚Ç¨350 worth of CRO coins and hold it for 6 months. After this time you're free to sell your CRO them again (or keep if you want to retain the card benefits).

**Important note:** you don't need to put crypto on the card, you can just load it with Euro or USD and spend it!

All cashbacks (Spotify and 2% of every payment are paid in the CRO cryptocurrency. You can immediately sell the CRO in the app for pounds/euros, which you can use again for purchases with the card if you want.

\--

**Personal experience:**

I've been using the Ruby Steel card for two months now. After my staked ‚Ç¨350 I got the Ruby Steel card and a bonus of $25 worth of CRO. I loaded some Euro on the card and changed my payment card on Spotify. After about two weeks my first payment of the monthly Spotify Premium went smoothy through and [Crypto.com](https://crypto.com/) paid the $12.99 back with CRO which I sold for Euro again. Smooth and really easy to do so.

Also the metal debit card looks awesome :)

My partner's solution is to just take the shower head off its bracket and put it down by the drain so you couldn't hear the dripping anymore. This of course does not solve the collosal waste of water.

It then occurred to me that the reason it starts dripping 3-4 hours after use is due to the seals contracting as they cool down.

I have now started running the shower on its coldest setting for a few seconds before I turn it off to pre-cool the seals so they're already cold when I turn it off. And it's worked! Hurrah! No more 2am shower dripping!

Seeking the advice of any health professionals out there: I‚Äôve always been a pretty decent sleeper. Throughout my adult life I‚Äôve probably averaged 6-7 hours per night. 

Over the last year, my work/life schedule has changed and I‚Äôve been able to sleep much more. And I‚Äôve taken advantage of it! For the last year I‚Äôve averaged 9-10 hours per night; occasionally 11. I love it and I feel great. 

I‚Äôve always believed that sleep is one of the best things for your brain, immune system, mood, etc. However, when talking to friends about sleep recently, a few people have said they think that at a certain point, excess sleep can actually have a negative impact on a person‚Äôs health.

I'm hoping and wondering if someone can help me.

I had to factory reset my Samsung phone, but have run into a big problem as I can no longer access my Google account which was signed in on this phone, so I can't sign in and continue to use my phone anymore and it's just stuck on the Google log in.

I've been researching and looking for a way to bypass the Google login after a factory reset but a lot of this suggestions are not helpful.

A lot of the suggestions are telling me to download a Google account bypass app onto my phone, but I obviously can't do this as I can log into the phone to access the play store or downloads.

I downloaded a bypass software to my tablet and plugged the phone in to try and bypass the Google account but it didn't work and all of the other PC software suggestions didn't work or weren't able to download them.

I can't afford to pay for bypass software right now and can only use software that is free but I'm struggling to find something which works.

I've searched and searched on Google but have found no solution, so I have had to reach out to the intelligent minds on Reddit that can hopefully help me out.

Does anyone know how I can successfully bypass my Google account after factory reset and set up my phone?

I cannot log into my Google account at all, I don't know what's wrong with it but I'm unable to reset my password and can't get in anymore, and therefore cannot use my phone, which I desperately need to work as I have no other phone and this phone cost me a lot of money and I only just bought it recently and I'm not able to afford to take the phone into a shop to get the Google account removed/bypassed either so i am desperately seeking a free solution which I can do myself at home that works.

I'd appreciate any suggestions, thanks","Samsung Factory Reset, Google Account - Locked And Blocked",lifehacks,False,0.0,1.0,1.0

Mondays can be really frustrating especially if you didnt rest enough for the weekend and you just have to jump into the next week. It just makes the rest of the week easier to get through if the start of it goes really good. After a while your subconscious starts looking forward to Mondays and realeases extra dopamine once you reward yourself. Only downside is you are horny every Monday.

Jaguar-Aggressive,t2_8rddgn7d,1642587403.0,"I recently found out about this website and it works like charm, have been using it for about 2 months and received about 400$ worth of products. At first, I thought it was a scam judging by the poor quality of the website.

You need 2 things to qualify:-

&amp;#x200B;

1. Have an Amazon Account at least 6 months old
2. Have at least 5 Amazon reviews(If you don't, complete it and come back to this post)

Also, if you don't have any previous orders, you could just buy 5 products from Amazon and then return them, you could still be able to review, try to have good reviews tho

Next, Sign up on [this](https://www.eirevine.com/Buyer/signin?is_invite=us&amp;utm_source=refer&amp;utm_campaign=online&amp;utm_medium=30124432) website, you could start small by buying something cheap but useful(that's what I did because I wasn't sure if this was legit), once it's delivered post a 5-star review, and then submit a screenshot of the review on the website, they will reimburse you the money on Paypal or others, if this doesn't work(which it has been for me) you could always return the product and get your money back from Amazon.

I suggest not to try to get Money from Return as well as Rebate as that will just get you banned and even though you might make some money, you're literally stopping yourself from getting stuff, I tried doing that and you're somehow banned to use other emails as well.

Full Disclosure: the link is an affiliate that will make me some commission but I have also tried it out myself and found value in it which is the main reason I posted it here, if it doesn't work, you could downvote this.

drzgy,t2_hygokcki,1642541940.0,"If you ever get frustrated because your cloud storage is taking too long to sync files, or isn't syncing the files at all or is not behaving as expected, the problem might lie with the data you are trying to sync and not the cloud storage service itself. After a lot of frustrating trials, and in some cases loss of data, I have learnt these valuable unsaid rules for cloud storage.

1. If there are too many small files, e.g. 20,000 less than 100 kb, try to zip them and upload. It will be much faster to zip-upload and download-unzip as required for use. 
2. If you need to zip files which are too large, try splitting the zip files in 1-2gb files. Cloud storages have hard time syncing more than 5gb files and sometimes it can take multiple trials to sync the file which wastes a lot of time.
3. The cloud storage seem to prefer folder structure when performing a sync. Limit having a number of folders with few files. It'll be much faster to sync 100 folders with 100 files each compared to 1000 folders with 10 files each.

I will post more as I learn more. Feel free to comment your preferred methods. Hope it helps anyone struggling like me.",Best ways to use the cloud storage,lifehacks,False,0.0,1.0,1.0

ccafferata473,t2_pmr3i,1642475894.0,"So I have a to do handman type list for my house. This weekend, I had a few car related things to do - wipers, refill washer fluid, headlights and turn signal, air in the tires. Most of the tasks went fairly smoothly - except for the headlights and turn signal. It took me 3 hours to do change the headlights. Why may you ask? Simple - it turns out my car (2012 Chevy Malibu) requires that I take out about a dozen 10mm bolts, a dozen plastic clips to remove my front bumper. And that's before I can unscrew the headlight housing to replace the bulb. 

Needless to say, after a lot of awful words and some scrapes, I hit an epiphany:

1. Write down all of the maintenance skills you know how to do - it could be knowing how to use a screwdriver to welding. Anything basic tool related skills.
2. Do online research - there's enough information out there on maintenance costs and the like, it's worth spending the time to understand what you're likely going to put in the car.
3. Once you've got it down to a couple of cars, hit YouTube - search basic things like tire changes, headlight changes, where the intake is for your fluids (wiper, oil, tranny, etc.) and watch the videos to see if you're capable of doing that.

I hope this helps as a life hack - you'd be surprised how much you could do with a little patience, some basic tool skills and a little foresight and research.","When purchasing a car, be sure to check on how to do your regular maintenance.",lifehacks,False,0.0,1.0,1.0

bjnc89,t2_1f8cr65n,1642376500.0,"I just got my first round of winter snow where I live. I have 2 cats, Penny and Alice. Penny uses litter box no problem, but Alice was a stray and does not like using the box, she has to go outside.

I let Alice out to pee, and 5 minutes later realized how dumb I was. Now the cat would likely hole up somewhere and there'd be no way to get her in, and it was getting dark soon.

I tracked her paw prints in the snow to the house across the alley from us, where no one lives currently. She likes to go under the outbuilding and hide. I call her name and of course she wont come out. I go back into my house to regroup.

I start to think. What draws predators- like cats- almost without fail? 

Injured prey.

I went on YouTube and opened the first video that popped up on search; an injured starling distress call. I then grabbed my bluetooth speaker and sat it outside under our outbuilding roof and retreated back into the house, connected the speaker to my phone, and hit play. I could hear the loud screeches emanating from the speaker from where I was, inside the house.

No sooner than 5 seconds after I hit Play, a black and white head popped out curiously from under the outbuilding. Intently peeking her head up into the air, she swiftly crawled out from her hidey hole, and began moving in the direction of the speaker. I waited until she got a few feet from it, then made my appearance outside.

Luckily, Alice is the type that doesnt run from you, as long as you carefully move towards her while lovingly talking to her. ""Heyyy, kitty kitty... what're ya doing out here??‚ò∫Ô∏è "" When you get close enough, you can just reach down and pick her up with little protest other than a resigned ""Mwreeaaoorrr..üòë"" 

I then hoisted the lanky furball back into the warm house, and all was well.

So, if your feisty feline wont answer your kitty kitty calls, give this trick a whirl.

If you dont possess a bluetooth speaker, the same results could probably be achieved by opening your window and setting your phone on the windowsill, with speaker oriented facing out the window. Maybe place it in an empty shoebox placed on its side to make a improvised speaker amplifier.

PakkyT,t2_1qt3av7x,1642000857.0,"On Windows computers, it is very easy to directly type characters from the [extended ASCII table](https://www.webopedia.com/definitions/extended-ascii/). Naturally no one normally needs most of these but if you tend to want to use a certain character often, you can do it this way.

Hold down the Alt key and then, using the [numeric keypad](https://www.typinglounge.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/number-pad-10-keys.jpg) on the right side of an extended keyboard, type in the 3-digit decimal ASCII code (for ASCII characters under 100 use a leading zero, aka 087 for W).

As an example, I often like to use the degrees symbol which is Alt 248. So when I need to type in a temperature I can easily write 87**¬∞**F.

Need to type the infinity symbol? Alt 236 gets you **‚àû**

Plus/minus? Alt 241 **¬±**

Greater than or equal (Alt 242) **‚â•** or Lesser than or equal (Alt 243)  **‚â§**

Need to indicate a **¬º** of a cup in a recipe? Alt 272

And so on. You can also type in the normal ASCII characters as well, but it would be kind of weird to type Alt 087 for **W** when the keyboard has it already, but you can if you like.",Typing characters from the extended ASCII table such as the degree ¬∞ symbol,lifehacks,False,0.0,1.0,1.0

StrainFar4756,t2_8211x5cs,1641932145.0,"This is a tip to prevent previously opened jars of sour cream from separating and creating that unappetizing watery sour cream juice on the surface of the cream the next time you open it. It‚Äôs really simple, all you do is before you close the jar and put it back in the fridge, take your spoon and use it to smooth out the remaining cream so the surface is flat and level similar to how it is when you first open it. The flat level surface of the sour cream is why an unopened tub of cream that has been sitting on the supermarket shelf or in your fridge doesn‚Äôt have juice on top when you first open it. The juice is actually whey and is perfectly safe to eat (just kind of gross) and is already in the sour cream to begin with, it is just in suspension. It is not created by a reaction to air or anything related to opening the jar. It occurs because the sour cream is a suspension containing multiple different components. Most of the components that make up sour cream are viscous enough to resist the force of gravity but the less viscous whey is not, so if you put the jar away with high and low spots on the surface surface of the sour cream, then over time gravity causes the liquidy whey to slowly fall out of suspension in the higher areas of the cream and run down and collect in the lower spots. As long as the surface of the cream is flat and there aren‚Äôt any high or low areas then the gravitational potential energy is equal for the entire jar and there isn‚Äôt enough potential energy to cause the whey to separate from the rest of the cream.",Sour cream juice,lifehacks,False,0.0,1.0,1.0

I would like to focus on transforming our apartment, behavior, shopping etc. into a sustainable, environmentally positive and tiny bit better human footprint this year. 

I am looking for any ideas, tips &amp; pointers on what to go after and how to do that. 

I am thinking of any tips for home, energy, waste, transport, groceries, clothes, cosmetics etc. probably missing big buckets that I cant even think of. 

I would hope to avoid an argumentative discussion of what is more sustainable, is it really good or any hardcore partisanship either way. Respectfully, I am not from the US and I want to avoid any political debate.  

I am trying, not there yet but you have to start from somewhere. 

E.g. changed all our lights into energy efficient, sustainable, long life bulbs. Got an electric car, using bikes for daily commute, incorporating vegan/vegetarian days (for a beginning), separate and recycle home waste etc.","What practical changes can I make to become environmentally friendly, reduce waste and increase sustainability?",lifehacks,False,0.0,1.0,1.0

Sure, you think you've learned the formal way to talk to girls (being a gentleman who knows what to say to her and what not). But do you understand how to carry a conversation WHILE knowing how to get a girl to like you?  


Almost every email and request I get involves a question related to how get a girl to like you, how to get a girlfriend, how to make a girl want you, and how to get a girl turned on.. (I help men for a living) AND Despite having literally multiple things to work on in order to answer these - I've found one thing that helps as a great first start: Conversation skills.  


Most dating advice centers around how to talk to girls and how to flirt. You're thinking.. ""Well talking involves so much preparation and memorization and adjusting and..."" - STOP. Don't overthink it!  


Having memorized thousands of one-liners or pickup lines or banter doesn't matter. Because that will end up with you faking your interaction.

Let us have a look at some tips we could put into practice to start changing our mindsets about negativity and positivity and live a more fruitful and emotionally balanced life.

Martyrialism,t2_50479ajf,1641590356.0,"It is a common misassertion that peeing in the shower is a life hack because it is more environmentally friendly (due to the saved water you would otherwise use flushing). In spite of the latter's truth a  regular discharge of urine into the shower cubicle exposes your plaster/tiles and drain to substances it was not designed for (in such requiring regular bleaching). 

But the biggest problem is that evaporating urine (due to heat of water) joins the water steam and introduces ammonia and bodily waste into the wall condensation. This will over time theoretically lead to stubborn mould (both of these issues depend on the water pressure of your shower of course). 

In conclusion it is simply better to urinate in the toilet (and if you are worried about water usage do not flush and simply return the lid to the horizontal position to reducing scent).",Instead of peeing in the shower return the toilet seat lid,lifehacks,False,0.0,1.0,1.0

vk011i,t2_9zu1bcij,1641520918.0,"This is a bit involved and you might think I‚Äôm neurotic about it. They psychology behind the $10/month is that since it‚Äôs only $10 you don‚Äôt stress if you don‚Äôt use the gym and just pay it every month. In reality, they all charge an initiation fee and a ‚Äúyearly fee‚Äù or something along those lines usually a few months after you sign up. Suddenly you‚Äôre not paying $10/month‚Ä¶

It‚Äôs a bit of an involved process but follow along.

1) Always sign up when they waive the initiation fee (usually around jan/feb). If they are not waiving it, I‚Äôve found two ways to get them to waive it, first just ask them to waive it. If they say no, then play hardball and say you‚Äôre not signing up unless it‚Äôs waived. My other method is lie and say one of the other employees said the initiation fee would be waived. This works at LA Fitness because usually a manager gets you signed up and they don‚Äôt like being proved wrong.

2) You‚Äôll get a contract and make sure you skim through it and look for the date you‚Äôll be hit with the ‚Äúyearly charge‚Äù and put that in your calendar. Why? Because you‚Äôre going to cancel your membership BEFORE that date. A key point is that a lot of these low cost gyms make it difficult to cancel your membership (usually in person and when a manager is on duty, which tend to only be during banking hours)

3) Go back and sign up again. If you‚Äôre too nervous to go back to the same gym, see if there is another low cost gym nearby.

Long story short, I don't have the latest computer. So some software programs can load slowly. Maybe... 5 -15 or 20 seconds slowly. What's worse, that small amount of time is all it takes for me to start thinking about everything but what I'm supposed to be thinking about, like the task on my screen. 

However, after installing a cool, new theme, I noticed a new cursor spiraling as though I was undergoing a wild, Dr. Suess, acid trip. (It replaced the boring, hour glass cursor for those that don't know about themes.) I even leaned in to check out all the different colors...

Then WHAM -- The task that I completely forgot about finally loaded and I was immediately back on track. 

Not once did I think about what could be on TV, what my kids are up to, my next hairdo, or any other infiltrator that often sends me into a spiraling, deep waste-of-mental-energy of its own.

I pretty much just picked right up where I left off.

cognaceast,t2_15q5dkfm,1641441543.0,"1. How to win a 4-way stop sign face off every time!

I figured this one out shortly after getting my driver's license as a teen. As you're pulling up to a 4-way stop sign intersection you notice 3 other cars are too. The best way to ensure your car will be the first one through the intersect. Stop short before getting all the way up to the stop sign. The name of this game is, ""who's car comes to a complete stop first"". I've come to find that bt doing this, 99% of the time you're passing through first.

2. Bait car

If you're on the highway and would like to make up some time by picking up the pace a little (within reason, don't become reckless and dangerous) keep your eye out for a car driving well above the speed limit. Let that car get out ahead of you a good distsnce, then pick up the pace. This isn't about tailgating, quite the contrary. You wanna keep that lead foot driver far enough ahead that if he passes a speed trap. The pursuing police will only catch them in their net, not you. This is called a bait car.",Lifehacks: Driving Addition,lifehacks,False,0.0,1.0,1.0

Some changes are in order re tabs &amp; labels, automatic filters, and also new accounts or aliases to separate certain types of email. I also thought a tool to receive messages in batches could be helpful.

One question about filters and alias accounts is separating, for company email's I subscribe to  addresses, sales &amp; promotional emails from orders &amp; ones for me individually. I also 'struggle' with newsletters that I subscribe to and 'bulking' them together.

Anyway, I am curious what you all do for your email setup?  And if there are other subs for this sort of optimization or productivity advice, I'd be super appreciative if you can direct me. Cheers!",Request: optimizing email setup,lifehacks,False,0.0,1.0,1.0

Also, if you do this, and it‚Äôs freezing out, the water that melted the ice will freeze over and form new ice. In this case turn your car on and run your wind shield wipers before you pour the water, that way the wipers push the water away before it has a chance to freeze.

Jacob__photo,t2_901hpw94,1641226312.0,"Socialgood is an app that offers cashback for your purchases (in that aspect it is similar to Topcashback, Quidco etc.); however, the cashback is paid in their own token - SocialGood (SG). The token is not new, it has been trading for over a year (see¬†[Coinmarketcap](https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/3409617203423199378/171072725654705694#)) and is listed on Bittrex and Bitmart, so can be withdrawn to these exchanges easily.

They're currently running a limited-time¬†[$200 promo](https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/3409617203423199378/171072725654705694#)¬†until 31st January:¬†

* they've¬†**increased their referral bonus to $200**¬†\- to claim this you must sign up with a referral link before 31st Jan and make a purchase of at least $30 (\~¬£22.50) within 30 days of joining. The purchase can be¬†**in any currency,**¬†but the total must be equivalent to at least $30. Shipping costs are excluded so I'd recommend that your purchase is a little over the required amount just to be safe.
* they've increased the cashback rates for popular stores and are offering up to 100% cashback on some. For instance, you can get 100% cashback at Aliexpress;¬†**50% at eBay,** [Booking.com](https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/3409617203423199378/171072725654705694#), and others. The boosted cashback rates may change at any time - these are not their usual rates.
* This is all app-based, the app has a built-in browser that you must use in order to receive cashback. E.g. if you'd like to buy something on eBay then you'd open eBay through the app, log in to your account and make your purchase as usual. (Make sure that your shopping basket is empty before clicking through to eBay.)
* **Steps:**

1. Sign up through¬†[**my referral link**](https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/3409617203423199378/171072725654705694#)¬†https://referral.socialgood.inc/?id=NLE9UU and ensure that the code¬†NLE9UU¬†has been pre-filled for you during sign-up.
2. Once you've signed up, you'll see the $200 sign-up bonus as 'pending' in your shopping history.
3. To activate the bonus, make a purchase of at least $30 in any store. Shipping costs and other charges do not count so I'd advise making sure the purchase itself is over $30 (e.g. ¬£30 if you want to be completely safe). The purchase must be done through the in-app browser unless stated otherwise.
4. Your purchase will show up as 'pending' in your shopping history within a few days. I just bought something off eBay and it tracked within 24 hours -¬†[proof](https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/3409617203423199378/171072725654705694#)¬†(you can also see my $100 bonus - the 120 SG).
5. Once your purchase is approved, your $200 sign-up bonus will be automatically approved as well. (Like with other cashback sites, the approval process can take a month or so, depending on the store - this is to ensure you haven't returned your items.)

kweenbuzz,t2_em6jo0da,1641100688.0,"Our family have a newly acquired vacation home. It's a home that we will all occupy occasionally, and each nuclear family will use on their own as well. I was hoping someone would have some clever tips for managing towels, linens, etc. or anything else. On the one hand, I'd like the house to have everything we need there and ready. But it doesn't seem totally realistic to just leave everything there. Assuming that we want fresh bedding for each new stay everyone who uses a bed needs to replace the used linens with clean sheets prior to departure. Each load of sheets take approx 2 hours to wash and dry, can't easily launder all bedding (and towels) on the day of departure. So, is the best plan to bring sheets for each bed that will be used during the stay and place those clean sheets on the beds prior to departure (so the bed is made up and fresh upon next arrival)? Feels like it sort of defeats the purpose if one has to bring up clean sheets every time they intend to stay at the house (plus towels). Would love to hear if anyone has a better idea regarding linens or anything else! Thanks",Vacation Home Hacks Wanted,lifehacks,False,0.0,1.0,1.0

**Crypto.com** **($25)**

Crypto.com offers Visa debit cards that provide cashback, a free Spotify Premium and a range of other perks. I've been using the card for more than a year already and made way more from the cashback and Spotify rebates than my initial investment!

You need to apply for their ""Ruby Steel"" debit card when applying, its a 0 risk debit card, no credit impact, no fees. To apply for the card you need to stake ‚Ç¨350 worth of CRO coins that you need to hold for 6 months. After this time you're free to sell them again (or keep if you want to retain the card benefits). You can easily **recoup the initial cost within a year** and after that you can still use the benefits.

Steps:

**CakeDeFi ($35)**

Cake Defi is a decentralized finance platform based in Singapore, utilising the Defichain blockchain which is secured by anchoring with the Bitcoin blockchain. Cake Defi offer a very generous $30 sign-up bonus, paid instantly as DFI (Defichain), for anybody who deposits $50 of crypto. This does not require any additional transactions or trades, just a deposit which you will be able to instantly withdraw if you need to.

Cake Defi is currently best accessed via the website, although mobile applications are being developed and are currently undergoing beta testing.

[Referral-Link to get the $30 Bonus](https://app.cakedefi.com/?ref=571562)

[Non-Ref Link (no Bonus)](https://app.cakedefi.com/)

1. Sign-up to Cake Defi using the re-ferral link to ensure you receive the bonus
2. Verify your identity using photo ID. This used to take up to 72 hours, but is much quicker now
3. Deposit $50 of cryptocurrency. There is a limited number of cryptocurrencies that can be used and if you are planning to withdraw your deposit instantly I would strongly recommend DASH as it has the lowest withdrawal fees. Bitcoin Cash has the next lowest withdrawal fee, followed by Doge and then Litecoin. I suggest checking the withdrawal fee page before signing up to see which suits you best.
4. Once your deposit has been received, your sign-up bonus of $30 will be paid into your account instantly as DFI. This will be staked and locked for 180 days however it does earn interest during that time, currently around **35% APY!** Go to the freezer section and turn off auto-renew if you will want to withdraw after 180 days.
5. The DASH, or whatever you deposited, can be immediately withdrawn to wherever it was deposited from and if necessary, exchanged to GBP and withdrawn to your bank account.
6. After 180 days, withdraw your bonus along with the interest it has accrued.

I have been really impressed with Cake and Defichain as a whole. I invested a bit more than the $50 and due to Liquidity Mining it already gave a nice bonus which I really apprechiate. I am now using the Freezer on Cake Defi to stake more DFI over a much longer timeframe than the initial 6 months as the APY is fantastic, the longer timeframes gives discounts on fees and I can see the value of the coin appreciating over the next few years.

And then you flush. Thrice just to be safe. The pressure will unclog your toilet and then you throw away the trashbag and yep all done.

Today, I was having hiccups again and they were annoying so I snapped and said out loud ""STOP!"", again in an intentional and firm way. And it worked again!!!!!!!

I tried googling about this, but I couldn't find any science or literature or even a single article or sentence suggesting that this could work.

So this was only two times and I'm looking forward to trying this again üòÇ if it works again, then I'd have really hacked hiccups.

When I sleep at 11-12 o'clock to wake up at 8 to be at work at 9 I have trouble to start my day. I often come too late to work because my body is heavy and my head feels dizzy. I can't move and my feelings are bad. My usual reaction is to try to sleep more, but I realised when I wake up at 5:50 to 6:30 I suddenly feel like a human being. No big problems at all, except the different day night rhythm so that I don't know if I can hold this structure for long. By the way I have depression and low blood pressure.

Ok, this hack is a lifesaver. I learned it from a friend who backpacks/camps a lot. I know they make weird funnel devices for women to pee standing up with, but did you know it‚Äôs possible to do it on your own? You just need strong pelvic floor muscles and a bit of practice. Here‚Äôs how:

1. Stand with your feet slight apart, and your crotch exposed (this can mean lifting up your skirt with your underwear down or pulling your pants down a little in the front‚Äîwhatever works).

2. Gently use your fingers (with both hands, one on each side) to spread your labia apart enough to expose the area where your urethra is.

3. Tilt your pelvis up and squeeze your pelvic floor muscles.

4. Keeping your muscles engaged and your labia spread apart, push your pee out in a nice strong stream. If you‚Äôre doing it right it will shoot straight forward. Watch out for your shoes! It may splatter a bit while you get the hang of it.

5. Enjoy a squat-free pee!

Note: My friend advises to practice in the shower to perfect your stream &amp; aim. Pelvic floor strength and really pushing the pee out fast are the key things to remember.",I‚Äôm a woman and a few years ago I learned to pee standing up.,lifehacks,False,0.0,1.0,1.0

roundballsquarebox24,t2_7at6641,1639331672.0,"In my culture we play a lot of dominoes. We use a double-six set, and play in pairs (2 vs 2).  I understand the game very well, and when I practice vs the computer and take notes of how each player played, I can play very well. 

But when playing in person, it is very important to remember the following things:
*How many bones of each number have been played, and which bones are still missing
*Who has passed on what bones (ex: player 3 passed when the position was 5-3, so I know he has no fives or threes)
*What numbers has my partner been ""killing"" (ex: he quickly, without taking time to think, played a 4, telling me he has no more fours)
*What numbers my partner has been looking for (He took 10 seconds to think before playing in the above-mentioned position, telling me he is working with multiple fours)
*Which number has any player has ""squared"" the game to. (Ex: there is a 3 on one end, and a 6 on the other end, and a player has the 6-3 bone. He can play that bone on either side, making the position have either a 6 or a 3 on both ends. I need to remember which side he chose to play)

There are many more nuances to remember, but these are the major ones. One thing I have been playing with is trying to run a number in my head replaying the game. For instance, the opening player plays the first bone, usually double-six. From that point, each player can either play to the right of the chain (which I mentally assign as 1), to the left of the chain (which I assign as 2), or they pass (which I assign 0). Then each play I update the number in my head. For example if the running number in my head is 11210112, I can reconstruct the position to know that player 1 passed on the second round, and by looking at the board I can know which position he passed on, and thus know what he doesn't have. This has been working, but it requires so much concentration that I can't really think about the actual game because all I'm doing is repeating this running number in my head.

Age of credit has a medium impact on your credit score and is the factor that can be hacked. To increase the average age of your accounts you can be added as an authorized user to a family member or friend‚Äôs oldest credit card. Ideally one that is 20+ years old. Say you do this and before all you had was one account that was 2 years old. By being added on another account that is 20 years old, you‚Äôve increased your average age of accounts from 2 years to 11 years. You‚Äôve also added an account which helps too (low impact). 

As an authorized user, you‚Äôre not liable for any debt incurred on the card either. It‚Äôs pretty much pure benefit unless they remove you from the card later. It‚Äôs also very easy to be added to a card, all you need is a phone call and maybe a form. The person adding you doesn‚Äôt even have to trust you because you can‚Äôt make changes to the account.

the_journey_taken,t2_9iaqes3d,1638596022.0,"the hero is us. it is not a persons identity, it is a consquence of a persons openness to experience. there lies a little viallage in a valley surrounded by mountains. the land beyond the mountains is dark, unchartered. the people of the village are content. they simple lives and all their simple needs are met, most of the time. there are neighbouring villages a distance away. no trade happens between these villages becuase they all produce more or less the same and so there is no need to echange. 

there is a young man in this village. he spends his time looking at the mountain ridges, wondering what could be there. his parents and older members of the village have told him countless times of the wild beasts that lurk beyond the darkness of the mountains. only one person had ever left the village before and had never been seen again. it was forbidden to leave, as this would mean certain death, although there was the odd rumor of something valuable in the darkness. the young man grew distant from those around him. he was tired of the stories and fear.

one dull day when everyone was indoors, the young man started walking away from the village towards the mountains. he climbed and walked, walked and climbed. all the way expecting to see a beast around the next bend. despite this fear he kept walking, and climbing. eventually after a while the young man arrived in the dark place, but it wasnt dark. it was lit, just like where his village was. it was on flat ground, just like his village was. there were no beasts, just like his village had. there was one difference though. where his village would have been there was a large pile of gold. the gold was just sitting there, free for the taking. there was no one to take, and no thing to stop him from taking it, it was just sitting there.

the young man picked up the gold he could carry and walked casually back to the village. he knew now that there was nothing to be afraid of. he had walked into the darkness only to find that it was not darkness, but light. it just appeared dark from the outside. the young man arrived at the village.the villagers were shocked and elated simultaneously. how could shuch a young man walk into the dark place and come back with so much gold. more gold than what any one villager could earn in a thousand life times.

the young man gave the gold to those around them. the portion he kept for himself was worth more than the annual output of any one village. the young man used the gold to attract others like himself from the other villages and he bought the best tools and machinery to make the higher order tools that he kew could assist the villages to all unite as one, and move foreward through the human experience at a rate that couldnt even be imagined by the average villager.

this is just a simple hero archetype merged with a simple and succinct charachter arc. this pattern is in any hero storey. the guy that feels that he is different goes where no one else has gone before and finds out that it is not only possible for him, but for everyone else. this is the value that the hero brings back from the dark place, from chaos. he brings back valuable thing that can be used by others. the most valuable thing that be brings back however, is the pattern of his being.

this is the pattern that exists in the person who is willing to go against the tide with the faith that doing so will make reality better for all other persons. these are the elon musks of the world. when catholics eat the bread and drink the wine, they are not cannabilising one of their own. they are not literally eating jesus in the hope for physical sustenance. they are embodying the pattern of jesus's being in the hope that they adopt it and become the hero.

the most important thing is the pattern. find it and program yourself with it. do great things physically, mentally, intellectually and/or spiritually. you dont need to start tesla to be the hero. you just need to not be afraid of going to the dark place when you want to. what ever the dark place represents... starting a new job, learning a new skill, trying a new activity, or just walking up to the guy or girl and introducing yourself. 

you must be able to go to the dark place, and must know why it is the right thing to do.",meta life hack,lifehacks,False,3.0,1.0,1.0

2. Buy a package of rice that will last about a month, 1 lb in this example - $3

mikayla_rivera,t2_veq5w,1648762384.0,"On Christmas Day, I got a speeding ticket driving to my parent's house for breakfast. It sucked especially since I had just spent quite a bit on presents for my family and was also transitioning to a new job. 

It was raining, and the cop that pulled me over was quite a bit in front of me and was also driving. I was speeding but was at the speed limit again by the time I was about 5 car lengths or so behind him. Despite this, he pulled back behind me and pulled me over anyway. I ended up getting a hit with a fine for about $300-400 + traffic school.

Now here is the part I didn't know, it only cost me $99 to get a lawyer and so far my lawyer pleaded not guilty for me on Valentine's Day (my court date lol) and now my case is on hold for possibly the next 6+ months. So not only do I not have to pay for my ticket or go to traffic school anytime soon, but I actually have a good chance of winning my case.

FYI the officer that gave you the ticket has to show up to the case and show evidence to prove the conviction otherwise the case is dismissed. If this case is dismissed, you avoid points on your record, traffic school, fines, insurance increases, etc. and this was all for $99. 

Reasons for a lawyer:

* More time to get money for the ticket if you do lose
* Possibility of reduced fine
* Potential Errors on Ticket = dismissal
* Radar Gun/Traffic camera can't be proven to have correct calibration when the ticket was issued = dismissal
* You were going above the speed limit because of safety reasons like to avoid an accident = reduced fines or dismissal
* Officer got the wrong car = dismissal
* Officer didn't have a clear view = dismissal
* You have already used your traffic school or you already have points on your record and cant have another ticket

So in the case that you do get pulled over, make sure you know what the officer is stopping you for, write down details of everything in the moments before getting pulled over(surroundings, where the cop was, where you were pulled over, if something effected your ability to follow traffic laws, etc), and don't argue with the cop.

SunstyIe,t2_ha7v6,1648761219.0,"We see ads everywhere we go on the internet, and while many people get served ad content they like since the ads are targeted to our interests, it can be problematic when you're being served ads for things you don't want to be tempted by. 

For example, maybe you're trying to lose weight but getting hit with fast food ads. Or you're trying to stop drinking but you're consistently shown ads for alcoholic beverages. Or perhaps you had a pet die, but you keep getting shown ads for pet products and it's bumming you out. 

The good news is that you can change what ads you are shown fairly easily.

A large portion of ads we see on the net (\~30%) are served directly from Google, and a good many others buy their data from Google. Ad data is personalized on a per-user basis based on what a person searches for, what sites they visit, what content they interact with, etc.

Google allows you to directly see what they know/assume about you, and what your interests are. They (and advertisers) use this to influence what ads are shown to you. Thankfully, they also allow you to mark items as not being of interest to remove you from the ad pool. But don't think of it as altruism on Google's part- they want their ads to be more effective, and so if you self-select what you're interested in then they can advertise to you more efficiently. 

To view and update your Google ad interests, click here and turn off any ""interests"" you don't want to see ads for:  [https://adssettings.google.com/](https://adssettings.google.com/) 

That will impact ads you see across a huge number of places on the internet, and will give you some control back on what is being shoved in your face constantly.

Also, anytime you see an ad for something you don't want advertised to you, check to see if the platform has a button for ""Why am I seeing this ad?"" (ex fb and ig). Click it, then select ""I do not want to see this again"". Repeated use of that tool will influence advertisers behavior since they won't want to waste money showing ads to people that aren't interested.",LPT: You can change what ads target you across the internet with a few simple clicks,LifeProTips,False,1.0,1.0,1.0

‚Ä¢Yes, you should have a diet with healthy foods and fiber (vegetables, etc.), but it's equally important to make sure you drink lots of water so your body can digest the fiber better (prevents stool from becoming too dry/hard, which can lead to straining). Water is key.
‚Ä¢The goal of the first tip is to get your stool soft enough so you won't need to push while pooping. Do not push! This can lead to hemorrhoids. 
‚Ä¢Don't bring your phone or a magazine into the bathroom and distractedly sit on the toilet for 10+ minutes. Too much time on the toilet can put pressure on the veins in your rectum, which can lead to hemorrhoids. The goal is to get in and get out as quickly as your movement is over.

Of course any issues should be discussed and seen by a doctor, but I hope these few tips can help some folks out.

Well apparently if you sit for a living, and lose weight quickly, without doing any strength training or muscle building, it can cause a host of health issues; more specifically- coccyx and pelvic floor dysfunction (affects bathroom, sex organs, and is extremely debilitating).

danielrosehill,t2_poc45,1648636786.0,"I do my best, like all of us, to minimize my exposure to spam telephone calls. 

However, there's only so much that any of us can do (short of enforcing a call whitelist which is probably the most robust method available but which is also problematic if, like I, you run your own business and occasionally need to field calls from unknown callers).

Over the years, I've developed a few common defenses - one of which I see was just posted on this sub.

Because I am an English speaker living in a non-English-speaking country I have an easy go-to in pretending to only speak English and not the local language. 

If that fails, I have memorized how to say ""I only speak Norwegian"" in Norwegian - assuming that the likelihood of the telespam caller happening to be a Norwegian must be vanishingly small. I recommend that everybody have this phrase on hand in whatever language is sufficiently obscure in the part of the world in which you live. 

But what if you pick up a call only to discover within seconds that it's a telesales spammer trying to sell you on marketing research?

Frequently I just hang up and then block the number. But sometimes one wants to hear the person out just a little longer. In other instances, one simply doesn't want to be so callous.

My new go-to for these situations is to pretend to be a gatekeeper to myself. 

I use the name of a non-existent personal assistant and say that I will bring the message to the attention of me ""if it is of interest"" -- which makes me feel slightly better because that part isn't a lie at least. Given that there's a 99% chance that whatever they're selling isn't of interest I won't be passing it on -- to myself. 

The sales caller now assumes I hope that they've gotten through to a PA with no purchasing power and I of course never pass on anything. 

Using this method, they seem to give up on the chase after one attempt, hopefully marking me off their call list as not worth bothering with.",LPT: Memorize the name of a fake virtual assistant and have it on hand for any unwanted phone calls,LifeProTips,False,1.0,1.0,1.0

Backstory: I was hired externally to work for a very prestigious golf tournament (pretty easy to figure out for most golf fans). Upon further discussion with peers I discovered there is a class offered by my university to help other students receive jobs for this tournament. I was hired by the golf club without them realizing I attended the university (even though it was included in my application). I emailed this professor regarding a shuttle that runs from the school to the tournament to save students from driving. Fast forward a day and my orientation information was removed from my dashboard, 2 days I receive an email back from her saying I can no longer work this tournament (she doesn't even work for the course) due to not being enrolled in her class, and she preemptively cleared it with HR for me to work next year without reapplying given I take her class. On top of this she cc'd my email and her response to the dept head and the HR department. I then email her back asking for clarification, no response (this was last Thursday), leave her a voice mail, no response. I immediately contacted HR for clarification and got confusing response that still left me with questions. this was a pretty big blow for me for a lot of reasons, and I deserve a response from her. its been nearly a week since news broke and I am still upset and want a response from her, nobody else, its the concept of it at this point.

I always thought that the people who went all the way to end of lane were real jerks, who tried to skip a few cars instead of merging early. TIL, I was dead wrong.

The Texas Transportation Institute conducted a study and concluded that zipper merges are actually faster, safer, and more efficient than merging early, especially when there's traffic. Zipper merging is where each car works collaboratively to allow one car from the right lane to merge left to form one line, just like in a zipper. In some places like Illionois and countries like Germany, zipper merges are law! 

Why is this faster? Because traffic buildups often occur when cars in the merging lane aren't given space  to merge, thereby bringing all the cars in that lane to a total standstill. When these cars then try to merge from a dead stop onto the path of oncoming traffic, they often cause collisions! Zipper merging means that both lanes are fully utilized and the vehicles in the merging lane can carry their speed into the highway. 

Merging early also leaves the right lane empty for some idiot on the highway to use as a shortcut, which is both dangerous and incredibly annoying. So now you know, cars at the merge point aren't trying to cut in line last minute, you NEED to let them in.",LPT: Always zipper merge onto congested highways.

1. Stop having FOMO. That 30% off is tempting, but don't buy clothes solely based on price. Try it on. Take photos of what you like and go home. You might find for cheaper online or maybe they'll actually have it in your size. If you're still thinking about that item a few days later, then go buy it. 


2. You want the best deal? Do your research. Use Google Lens to search for similar looking items in other clothing lines. Check second hand online retailers like Poshmark and ThredUp. Buy things towards the very tail-end of the season for the best deals. Avoid fall/holiday shopping.


3. Choose appropriate fabric. Expensive clothes need expensive maintenance or you will ruin them and waste all your money. You don't need to use silk pajamas, cotton is more durable and can be easily washed (imo). 


4. Shoes are the one item where you never want to buy one size bigger or smaller. Not talking about how different brands size differently. But never purposely try on shoes and buy a size up, thinking ""you'll grow into it"" or ""close enough""...You could twist an ankle that way. 

5. Find a tailor or learn to do some basic alterations. Everyone's body is different, and you won't find stuff off a rack that was designed to fit you. There's always something.

This is a trick for situations when you find yourself in an argument with a loved one or peer that you trust is, at least, not a complete narcissist (for whom this trick won‚Äôt work).

&amp;#x200B;

Arguments break down and become unresolvable when each side is focused only on vindicating themselves. To that end, some times arguments seem like a competition for resources, with both sides trying to ‚Äútake, take, take.‚Äù People are way more willing to fairly consider your side of the argument if you cooperate with them by first offering consideration of their side. So, when attempting to argue your side, begin with acquiescing some aspect of their argument first. First ‚Äúgive‚Äù, **then** ‚Äútake‚Äù. Template:

&amp;#x200B;

‚ÄúI can see how \*insert some aspect of their side you‚Äôre willing to concede\*. I just also think that \*insert some aspect of your side you want them to acknowledge\*.‚Äù

&amp;#x200B;

Offer one for them, ask for one for yourself.

&amp;#x200B;

In an argument, it **does not matter who is more correct, pragmatically. What matters is what can come out of the argument constructively. When you focus too much on your side being right, and their side being wrong, the argument is only destructive**. For this reason, appealing to each other‚Äôs psychology by offering respect will cut through the toxicity like a hot knife through butter.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

If your ever in a situation where you can not physically call 911 and are in need of emergency assistance, you CAN actually TEXT them. 

That‚Äôs right, you can text your location and situation to 911 to get help from police, fire or ambulance.

You can even have a pre made message in like your iPhone notes if say you have a heart condition or some condition where you are more susceptible to the need of emergency aid. Then you can simply copy and paste the message into a text and boom - help is on the way.

Parents, tell your kids this. Kids, tell your parents and grandparents. 

As much resources as we take checking Halloween candy for razor blades,  teaching kids to not take rides from strangers or adults to not leave our drinks unattended at a party or bar, you would think this would be mainstream knowledge.

Conscious_Total01,t2_iodjtqwy,1648512269.0,"Let me start of by stating that I have been to therapy with 3 psychologist. Currently I can't afford a private session and been trying to book a session with the college Counselors from January with no success.

I don't know if it's depression or what but I often feel like I live in another planet/universe,  out of touch with reality. Majority of the days/weeks I don't know what I did. I don't eat, drink water, bath or  even think. It's feels like my body is here and my mind in somewhere doing god knows what. 

Once after a week and a half somehow I do manage to study and actually prepare a meal. Reply to messages on WhatsApp, reach out to people, take walks etc... I usually take notes tracking what I did trying to find the thing that allowed me to do all the activities. But after that day I subsequently go back to the state of living I hate and after few days I will ""wake"" to the reality and usually by that time the food I had prepared that day, would be rotten with a bad smell and I would eat it. 

I currently live 2 hours from my home and the last time I was home my cousin told me his birthday is on the 25th of March. I promised to come. When the week started I was clear that I'm going home for a weekend Friday I will be with my family celebrating a birthday, Saturday I will see my girlfriend and go meet few of the friends I had not seen in a while but the biggest part was being with family and I had planned to give my parents some money. On Wednesday I confirm that indeed I will be home for the weekend, I text my friends that I will be home for the weekend. from Thursday to Sunday I don't know what happened. And I didn't go home as I had planned. I only woke up to the reality on Sunday night. Took a shower and went to dispose rotten food and prepaid new meal and worked on the assignment. I'm supposed to submit this week, then went to sleep.
 
During the festive season I had an opportunity to talk with my grandfather and asked him a lot of questions. Which made me realise what could be the potential cause of the way I live. Therapy wasn't working because we couldn't figure out the root course of the problem. My grandfather never worked, has no friends no interest. He spends his time inside the house (want to live alone) and occasionally if it's too hot sit outside. This is a life I see myself leaning towards. At least he does this consciously. My sister is like this also. I don't know if they enjoy their lives because I don't and I don't see myself living like this my whole life. I'm in college, being in college from where I'm from is a blessing and I have seen my capabilities and things I could achieve. My goal and dreams are possible but the only thing stoping me is these days that are unaccounted for. 

What I'm asking for with this are tips you think might help me. Live everyday.

Secondly, the only way to lose weight is to burn more calories than you take in. Eating specific foods will not magically make you lose weight.
A calorie is simply a unit of measurement. If you want to LOSE weight, look up/count how many calories are in the food you eat, and weigh yourself consistently. If you‚Äôre gaining weight or staying the same, reduce the amount of calories you eat by a small, non dramatic amount. On the other hand, you can add more exercise into your day to burn those calories off.

That‚Äôs it. That‚Äôs all there is to it.
The ‚Äòtrick‚Äô, the ‚Äòmagic secret‚Äô to weight loss is just finding out how many calories you consume, and reducing it. If you don‚Äôt lose weight, reduce more.
The only reason healthier foods are good for weight loss is because they have fewer calories. 
The only reason junk foods are bad for weight loss is because they have high calories.
It really doesn‚Äôt matter what you eat.
The only reason exercise is good for weight loss is because it burns calories.
If a fad ‚Äòdiet‚Äô says you can lose weight by cutting out these three foods, or adding these three instead, you‚Äôre being mislead. Calories in, calories out. Easy as that.

TLDR: The only way to lose weight is to consume fewer calories than you burn. It‚Äôs not about the type of food, just the calories.

BlastedBrent,t2_nw6yiv9,1648494034.0,"A bit of oldschool advice, but I've never really seen it talked about before. This might be because the option to Hibernate has been automatically hidden for most people since the windows 8 days, so you may need to [manually enable it in the control panel](https://www.groovypost.com/howto/enable-hibernate-mode-windows-10/)

Hibernate is essentially just putting your pc to sleep in a way that can survive losing power, combining the benefits of a proper shut down with the convenience of sleep.

The ""trick"" is simple, next time you need to unplug your pc or want to enter the bios:

1. Set your PC to Hibernate in the usual power menu
2. Pull the plug
3. (move your pc or take it apart or whatever you need to do)
4. Plug it back in
5. Power it on (you'll get a chance to enter the bios here)
6. After it posts, Windows will resume normally as if it was waking up from sleep

I'm sure most of us are aware of hibernate, but I figure since the option has been hidden by default for so many years, there are a bunch of new pc users, and it was always sold to us as a power saving feature--it might help some of you.

So I stopped brushing my teeth on a daily basis for a very long time and now all I do is drink squeezed

ORGANIC lemons with distilled water. I don't drink the pasteurized lemon juice in squeeze bottles or

the giant GMO lemons. When I first started this habit I didn't realize how beneficial it would be to my

teeth. I did it because I liked the way it made my teeth feel and also my breath smell. I will probably

floss my teeth every once in a while when I FEEL like its time do so or brush them if need be. Ususally

its weeks or even months in between and my girlfriend doesn't think my breath smells bad at all. Their

was a time before when I used to brush my teeth everyday and floss and eat a lot of sweets I would

always wake up with morning breath and my teeth just didn't feel that rigid or strong. Ever since I

have started living this way my teeth not only feel stronger but look healthier as well. The reason I

made this post is because everywhere I look on the internet about drinking lemon water it says TO

NOT DO IT. It will strip your enamel and blah blah blah. I think a lot of the cons that come with

drinking lemon water come from mixing it with tap water which is filled with GOD KNOWS WHAT. If

you want to learn more about what is in your local tap water go here

([https://www.ewg.org/tapwater/](https://www.ewg.org/tapwater/)) and just punch in your zip code. THe 50x, or 60x just means that is

how much extra of that chemical is in your tap water beyond the recommended government limits.

Also, I don't think the stuff we brush our teeth with is very healthy for us either. They put fluoride in

the toothpaste. I mean seriously how does that even make sense that we are doing this to ourselves

and accepting it as rational behavior. Honestly the proof is in my own personal experience. I just

wanted to share this with people who are afraid to drink lemon water. Just make sure you mix the

organic lemon juice with DISTILLED water. I squeeze one lemon into a 24 oz cup and if I decide to get

more water I will squeeze another lemon so usually I only drink 1 to lemons a day. Their is no harm in

doing so. Experiment for yourself. The toothpaste and tapwater will do more harm to your body than

drinking lemon water IMO. Have a great day everybody and thanks for reading.",LPT I drink distilled lemon water everyday,LifeProTips,False,1.0,1.0,1.0

A LIABILITY is NOT an item you can buy. A liability is DEBT. try not to purchase debt, wherever possible try not to buy credit. you have to pay interest on it. YOU take on the risk of insolvency. Debt grows exponentially. if you don't pay regularly, it will go to infinity. causing bankruptcy.

UNLESS that credit is funded for by a business. Businesses have profit but could also go insolvent or take losses, business owners take on risk, inherently. The share or stock of the business you buy takes on the risk of insolvency. Think of a house as a low risk business. the share of stock of the business is the house price, the net profit of the business is the rent cost, minus any taxes and upkeep fees, the risk of insolvency is secured by the house (the share of stock). Higher risk businesses generally produce better yield (return on investment). You may purchase shares in any kind of business, doesn't have to be a house as long as you are willing to take on the risk and grow it to make a profit as an entrepeneur, you can take home profits after paying all employees and costs, or you can reinvest those profits to further grow the capacity of the business. on the other hand you may purchase stock of publicly traded business, this is equivalent to owning a share of a business passively. you may receive a dividend if the business continues to be profitable, or if the business reinvest their profit and grows, then the stock price will go up with the share price, and you may sell at a profit minus fees. investing or trading in exchanges of stocks is literally the same thing as trading shares of businesses, except the share isn't determined by the ACTUAL value of the share, it is determined by supply and demand (publically traded). Traders assume that the market is efficient enough to figure out the share price accurately and fairly, meaning as share goes up positive correlation, stock price goes up. and the companies benefit from the extra public capital from investment. it can be risky, but through statistics and intelligence, you can control that risk by reducing volatility and increasing probability of success and increasing profitability with respect to some target in time/indicator. this is what stock traders do.

Money goes down in value with respect to the same goods and services, except in a recession,  this is inflation. only in a recession do you want to keep money.

so you will want to purchase ASSETS/business with spare money. this is risky, but is the only way to really make money. except for working. working is a situation where you yourself are an asset.

the other thing you may do with money is put it into savings accounts and make interest from it, this holds almost zero risk but you don't have freedom to change your mind and control and your money is locked in.

the other thing you may want to do with spare money is spend on bonds. this is to interest what public stocks are to private shares. bonds are essentially interest payment plans, except the price of the payment plan is decided by the free market. you would expect as the interest rate goes up, people will want to lend their money on other plans, so the bond price sells for a lower price. negative correlation.

the other thing you may want to do with spare money is spend on commodities. commodities can be liquid fungible like gold, silver, other currencies, bitcoin, oil or non fungible and non liquid, like paintings and watches. you may want to hold a significant portion of these, but you will more likely want to actively trade them than just hold them. they could rise or fall in value with respect to your currency. it is notoriously more difficult to make money by investing in other currencies (forex) than it is to buy stocks of business. they do not lose their value, but their value can fluctuate.

You statements with absolutes: ""*You're always* pushing me away these days. *You never* want to spend time with me. *You* *only* hang out with me when you have nothing better to do"" 

I statement with minimal absolutes, we-statements, focusing on emotions: ""Lately, I've been feeling far away from you.  **When** the only time *we* spend together is at the very end of the day, **it makes me** ***feel*** like *our time together* happens only after *we* are done with everything else. That makes me feel like spending time together isn't a priority *we share*, and *I am hurt when this happens in our relationship*. I'm feeling lonely and abandoned, and I don't want to feel this way...Is everything ok with you? I'm wondering if you're pulling away because something else is happening. I want to understand if you're struggling with something, either within or outside of our relationship. *I am here for you.*""

Ex2, Scenario: your partner continues to put dirty dishes into the sink, rather than directly into the dishwasher.

You statements with absolutes, and character assassination: *""You never* put the dishes into the dishwasher, no matter how many times I've asked. Are you a child? Am I your parent? I don't understand why you can't just do this simple task, it drives me crazy.""

I statements with no absolutes: ""**When** you put your dishes in the sink, rather than load them into the dishwasher, **then I feel** like you're expecting me to put them away for you. *That makes me feel like you don't respect me*. *The story I'm telling myself* is that it's a simple task that you're choosing not to do on purpose. I trust that you're not actively trying to disrespect me, but it still feels disrespectful. It feels like you don't care about how this impacts me, and that isn't a good feeling. I don't want to feel this way with you... What are your thoughts? How can we work together to address this?""

Ex3, Scenario: your partner has not been physically affectionate, nor have you had sex in quite some time.

You statements with absolutes, contempt and criticism: ""We haven't had sex in ages. *You never* touch me, do you even want me? Am I just that repulsive to you? You don't put *any* effort into our sex life. *I feel like I'm married to a fish*"".

I statements without absolutes: ""Lately, I'm starting to feel like you don't want to be close to me. *We* haven't been physically connecting *very often*, *we* haven't hugged or kissed *a lot*, and *we* haven't had sex *in a while*. **When** we aren't physically affectionate with each other, **I feel** scared that you don't want me. Right now, I'm feeling rejected and I don't want to feel this way with you... Can I ask, why do you think this is happening in our relationship? I want to understand your perspective so we can address this together. I want to fix this as a team.""

Using I-statements, We-statements, focusing on the emotional impact of behavior, and avoiding absolutes are essential factors to a **soft start up.** When we start hard conversations softly, with centering our *experience*, rather than feigning to have a factual interpretation of what's 'actually' happening, it's easier for someone to respond empathetically. Absolutes open the door *immediately* to defensiveness, because it's an invitation to argue about whether that is *always* happening or *never* happening. It's also easier to be critical or contemptuous towards our partner when we utilize you-statements, rather than I-statements.

Unfunded mandates will result in states or local governments paying to meet the requirements. This isn‚Äôt to say all unfounded mandates are bad. The Americans with Disabilities Act for example. However, be aware that unfounded mandates can push costs onto poorer school districts or municipalities further burdening their already strained budgets and tax base. When deciding whether to support legislation, make sure you understand how it will be paid for. One of the most recent examples was the No Child Left Behind Act enacted under George W. Bush. Some of the provisions were unfunded leading to lower income districts struggling to comply while also being held to the same strict standards of wealthy districts. Although there was a need to be able to compare school outcomes between states, the implementation was heavily criticized for disproportionately burdening low income districts.

I put in my 30 day notice at a hospital working in general surgery as an RN. Decided to protest with signs due to none of my requests to fix equipment, raise wages, increased on call shifts, and addressing staff issues over the months.

I finally have a meeting with HR and raise all of these patient safety concerns. Their only concern was using the buzz word ‚Äúpatient safety‚Äù to address short staffing, no breaks, etc. They didn‚Äôt care about fixing anything meaningful. The are worried about the chain of command and keeping their job like good little sheep. 

That night HR calls and they accepted my resignation 2 days in, and said they would pay me the remainder of the 28 days. Well, 2 months later, last week, I call, and they have nothing on file about paying me. 

They got me out of the way to protect the company from lawsuits, and creating too much noise addressing all of the things you hear about with employee retention, mental health, increased shifts, and patient safety.

Hospitals should not be run solely by business men/women. Healthcare is a different animal, and lives are on the line. Keeping labor costs down and profits up should not be a priority.

Shoes, clothes, cars, motorcycles, phones, laptops etc are all liabilities. If you buy something for $100, next year it will be $80, the year after $60. Eventually zero 

Assets like property, land, stocks/shares, digital assets are likely to increase in value. If you invest $100 today, it might be $110 in a year or $120 in 2 years.

HappyFun_Time,t2_jkkynqwr,1648278946.0,"Many desire to be happy, but not all are able to achieve it, and fewer still to maintain it. A lot of people expect happiness to appear before them, whether in the form of friends, a promotion at work, or a winning lottery ticket, and they focus on attaining these things as if it would solve most of their problems and make them truly happy.

Many things do make people happy of course, for almost everyone has hobbies or things that make them smile. But this happiness is often transient, with many losing it once the moment ends. Thus, the happiness that many desire is not happiness per se, but oftentimes contentment instead, when you are simply happy for what you have and where you are in life.

Being content does not mean a lack of ambition or a desire for change, but rather it is a state of acknowledging that what you have is already enough for you as a person. Although easy to say, it can be very difficult to achieve, for a minimum of 3 things must first be accomplished.

The first is minimum, or the absolute necessities needed for a reasonably comfortable lifestyle. No matter how positive one's outlook may be, maintaining happiness when one does not know when the next meal will be, or whether or not there will be a roof over one's head by nighttime, is extraordinarily difficult. However, once this minimum requirement is met, then any additional resources may grant increased opportunities for happiness, but far from guarantees it.

The second requirement is meaning. A life without hope, or one without meaning, is a life yet lived. Meaning is what motivates us, and hope is what allows us to keep moving forward. It is what allows us to feel that we matter, that we can actually make a difference in this vast world. In the end few may achieve their dreams, but hard work betrays little, and the act of striving towards a goal is in itself often what makes life worth living.

The third requirement is mindset, and this is most important of all. No matter how much one may possess, no matter how few obstacles or hardships they may face, if one does not have the right mindset then happiness may never be achieved. Despite what many might think, mindset is not as simple as comparing yourself to those less fortunate however, for the same argument could be used to claim that one could always compare themselves to those more fortunate. Instead, a proper mindset is being able to see the value of everything you might have or experience. It could be as significant as a mother's love, to something as small as a stranger holding open a door for you, for both of those actions acknowledge you as a person - that you exist and that you matter.

Happiness is not straightforward, and it is different for everyone, but happiness itself can never be given. Affluence may satisfy the first requirement, and offer opportunities for the others, but it cannot guarantee them. Meaning may be suggested, taught, or even granted, but unless it is borne from the heart of the individual carrying it, will never be genuine, and with mindset being similar. Thus, happiness is not given but found by the one that seeks it.

Happiness requires a conscientious effort, it must be grasped, and it begins with the letter M (minimum, meaning, mindset).

Thank you for entertaining my perspective. I am sure many may feel differently, and I recognize that happiness is much more complicated than this, but these are my personal ramblings and I hope that it may help others.","LPT: Happiness can never be given, it must be grasped by the person that desires it",LifeProTips,False,1.0,1.0,1.0

Casual disclaimer that this isn't medical advice nor is it a guarantee to work it's just something I discovered that helps me and it might help you.

Anyway...I have tinnitus. It's not noticeable until I'm in a quiet place, or trying to fall asleep. Then it can feel like my ears are ringing very very loudly, as though I can hear a constant high pitched ambulatory /emergency tone.

It used to really bother me until one night, while I was sleeping, I thought to try to see if I could still hear pure silence even if my ears were ringing. Not sure what made me think to try, but what I did was I switched from passive listening to active listening, and focused on my ear drums, and I tuned out the noise like it was background static and tried to detect any sound at all. Sure enough, the ""tone"" of tinnitus began to shift from inside my eardrum directly, into the back of my head. I began to realize that the noise I was hearing was more of a response to ear damage, than an actual sound I could hear. So while I had the tone inside my skull, just to the left / right of my ear, I began to breath slowly and concentrate. I imagined that there was a ""volume dial"" in my brain to ""turn down"" the volume of my tinnitus. It sounds crazy...but it worked. The one was significantly reduced, and I was able to briefly trick my brain into only hearing silence. 

Sometimes, the ringing comes back, but every time I try this technique it either gets rid of the tone, or is able to ""turn it down"" significantly. I feel like by concentration, meditation, and active listening for noise instead of passive listening when I hear tinnutus, I've been able to teach my brain to distinguish between ""imaginary internal noise"" and legitimate environmental sounds.

Hello,   
 

I am approaching a job offer soon and wanted to know if I can negotiate (maybe) a higher salary if they don‚Äôt meet my expectation, a higher performance bonus and also a sign on bonus?   
 

The offer I currently expect for a senior Finance Analyst: 112k - 115k base, and 10% performance bonus.   
 

What I want to counteroffer with: 115k base, 15% performance bonus, and also a 15k sign on bonus.   
 

Reasons behind my counteroffer: I have interviewed with other companies (some of which were in the same industry and some not) a good number of them said that the 115k base, 15% performance bonus were within the range and had no issues meeting that so I am using these other companies as a benchmark behind my counteroffer. Also seems that from my research for the specific area/industry/job what I want to ask for is reasonable.   
 

Reasons behind the sign on bonus: If I leave my current company I will be missing out on about 18k worth of performance bonus + profit sharing from the current company so I want to make up with the sign-on bonus I plan to ask for.   
 Is that a reasonable request? or maybe I should ask for more/less sign on bonus ?

calebbogart7,t2_2dsua9xl,1648137271.0,"So I‚Äôm sure everyone has been through this scenario: you‚Äôre driving on a 2 lane highway, and you come up to 2 slow cars ahead of you in both lanes that drives side to side next to each other going the same speed leaving no room or chance for drivers behind them to pass. Well this is quite common in bigger busy cities where driver awareness is just non existent. But where I live, a much more peaceful and small community, where things like this just doesn‚Äôt happen. I always call my town the ‚ÄúAmerican autobahn‚Äù because 99% of drivers move to the right lane when they see cars coming up behind and they know they‚Äôre slow. It‚Äôs incredible. But still I‚Äôve actually had encountered a situation like this at the beginning of the year, where I was driving on a 2 lane mountain highway and the sedan ahead of me in the left lane was obvious trying to block me/traffic from overpassing. Because every time there‚Äôs a driver on the right lane, he‚Äôd start driving EXACTLY the same speed as the other driver, blocking the lane. It was obviously intentional. There was even a semi that he tried to drive the same speed with. But it didn‚Äôt work out long, because both times the other drivers probably got annoyed and weirded out that there‚Äôs a car continuously driving next to them, so the other drivers eventually slowed down, leaving room and space for me to overtake the idiot. However, on my way to work today, this same thing happened again. And I‚Äôm sure it was intentional too. Because when I was trying to merge onto the highway, there‚Äôs this car that just had to get ahead of me in the merging lane, refusing to yield. And then after getting ahead of me, he immediately moved to the left lane, which is something he could‚Äôve done before the lane merged. But that‚Äôs fine, I don‚Äôt really care. So I was driving behind him in the left lane, and there‚Äôs traffic on the right lane. As soon as the traffic cleared on the right lane, he moved to the right lane and started driving exactly the same speed as the slow car now ahead of me. Keeping in mind this was very obvious that he‚Äôs doing it on purpose because he was suddenly slowing down to match the speed of the slow driver ahead of me. Leaving no room for me to pass or overtake. And I thought, that‚Äôs fine, the car ahead of me will probably move over just like usual. Boy I was wrong, the car ahead of me in the left lane just continued driving in the left lane, having no intention of moving over nor does he seem bothered with the fact that there‚Äôs a car driving right next to him all this time. And you could tell the idiot on the right lane was doing it on purpose even more so because every time the car ahead of me slowed downed a bit, or sped up a bit, that‚Äôs what he would do as well. I got really pissed, this lasted for about 1.5 miles before I was able to exit. I was close to honking the horn but remembered that my family always told me these people has empty lives and just wanted someone to play games with them. So I didn‚Äôt.

PrinceHal9000,t2_xni21,1648127449.0,"I'm writing this for those who are feeling overwhelmed, frustrated, defeated, angry, or generally just anxious about the current state of the housing market in the US.  I'm also writing this for those who are curious (morbidly so?) about what is going on, how we got here, and where it is going. 

HOUSING CYCLES  
Housing prices tend to follow boom and bust cycles.  Boom cycles are characterized by soaring prices and massive demand.  During bust cycles, plenty of housing is available for sale, but no one wants to buy, people are afraid to buy, or can not afford to buy it.  Over a long enough time frame, housing prices have historically appreciated, but it is not a linear process.  In my lifetime as an adult, there have been two big busts which saw housing prices drop significantly (the 2008 financial crisis and the immediate years after and for like *three to nine months* when COVID hit in 2020) and two big booms (the years leading up to 2008, and late 2020 through March 2022 as I write this).

It's important to note that the above analysis of housing cycles is WAY TOO GENERAL, because housing is predominately a LOCAL market issue.  A boom in the NYC market may coincide with a bust in the Detroit housing market.  The pain (or euphoria sometimes, but it's mostly pain) felt by local people trying to buy or rent locally  is unique to each locality.  Media tends to publish lots and lots of articles trying to generalize the problem nationally (because people like to read these articles and that's just what news media does), but no two *local markets* experience the same thing.  Some experience busts while others boom, and vice versa.

WHAT IS GOING ON?  
Even though each housing market is different, the price of housing in each market follows some  balance of SUPPLY and DEMAND.  Below are some specific issues related to the current state of housing in the US that are contributing in different proportions to the current boom in housing prices experienced in many markets.

DEMAND ISSUES  
1 - Interest Rates:  Interest rates have a very strong effect on what a buyer can afford to spend on housing.   Interest rates were kept near zero for much of the last ten years.  Eventually, more buyers have grown capable of affording to spend more on housing.  Prices have risen according to the increased demand.  Rising interest rates SHOULD depress demand and prices, as purchasers can afford less.  
2 - Remote Work:  As more companies adopt WORK-FROM-ANYWHERE policies, people who were formerly forced into expensive local housing markets in big cities can now enter a wider variety of local housing markets, driving up demand in local markets to new levels.  You WOULD THINK that this would result in price reduction in big cities, but that hasn't really happened and I don't totally understand why.  Maybe lots of city people just changed cities, resulting in no net loss to demand (NYC to Austin, Austin to LA, LA to NYC)?  
3 - Increased Retirement:  COVID caused an increase in earlier-than-expected retirement and many chose to sell homes in or near higher-priced city markets and move to (formerly) less expensive *retirement* markets.  
4 - Downsizing:  High prices cause some people to sell to ""downsize"", this can particularly drive up the cost of previously ""affordable"" homes as downsizing sellers seek less expensive property (usually as they head for retirement)  
5 - Higher Wages:  People are earning more, WHICH IS GREAT, but that means more people can spend more on rent or enter the housing market, increasing demand for houses.  
6 - Asset Appreciation: The stock market has risen, as have some other risky assets, and that is raising net worth.  It allows asset holders to liquidate those assets and convert it to housing.

SUPPLY ISSUES  
Put simply (and generally), there aren't enough existing homes to feed the demand in many local markets for a few reasons:  
1 - New Construction Supply Always Lags:  This is kind of obvious, but as more people enter a new local housing market, more housing will need to be built.  Houses don't grow overnight, it takes time to build new housing.  
2 - Lack of Construction Labor:  While demand for new home construction is high, labor hasn't expanded at a rate fast enough to meet the demand.  This is slowing the rate of new home construction.  
3 - Lack of Construction Materials: Construction materials are hard to come by and are expensive due to demand and supply chain issues.  This slows down construction and increases construction costs.  
4 - Legislation/Policies:  I'm not an anti-regulation guy.  I think regulations are necessary, but regulation tends to make it more difficult and expensive to build housing.  It's also very hard to craft good legislation that doesn't have unintended consequences.  Some areas (think major cities, California, etc.) are more heavily regulated.  To build anything, a developer is going to need an army of lawyers to get anything done.  Whenever armies of lawyers are involved, things tend to get a whole lot more expensive and move a whole lot slower.

WHAT TO DO ABOUT IT  
1 - Be Patient and Have Perspective:  When prices are soaring, markets go crazy and people think *it's never going to end, this time is different, government please do something!*  When prices are crashing, people panic and think *the world is coming to an end, this time is different, government please do something!*  Prices boom and bust.  The best thing you can do is have your finances is good shape so you can act when the market *eventually* turns and prices are in your favor.  Housing purchases tend to be coming later and later in peoples' lives.   Interest rates are starting to rise again which should have a significant effect on prices and demand in time.  You are not screwed if you didn't buy a house in your 20s or 30s.  I know this is cold comfort for those who are facing severe housing pressure right now, but be as patient as you can be.  
2- Be Mobile:  Housing prices should NOT be booming everywhere by the same amount.  There should be markets where housing is affordable.  If your job is mobile, and you don't have family commitments restricting your mobility, you can explore other markets that may be more favorable.  
3 - Don't Obsessively Consume Media Related to Housing:  Contemporary News Media is kind of designed to grab your attention and hold onto by any means necessary - scaring you or provoking your outrage is one of its primary tactics. Endless doomscrolling is not going to help your mental state.  
4 - Rely on Yourself:  Your ability to earn a living is the most important aspect of your financial outlook.  Earning more and saving more now puts you in a better position to enter the housing market later.  
5 - (For current renters) Build a Good Relationship With Your Landlord:  Landlords really value GOOD TENANTS.  A good tenant always pays on time, doesn't trash the place, never has cops called, etc.  The better relationship you can build with your landlord, the more they will want to keep you as a tenant, rather than risking bringing a tenant who will pay more, but might be totally awful.  This is obviously harder if your landlord is a large building corporation than an individual, but you can still be cool to the staff and people you interact with.  People are were may more likely to give you a good deal if they like you than they are if you are pain (unless they are shady and exploitative).

I‚Äôm going through so many thoughts right now (undergrad college student), mainly relating to friends. During the past few months I have been busy because I was trying to spend quality time with some of my family from abroad, whom I don‚Äôt see so often by the way (It might have been about 3 years since the last time I‚Äôve seen them). My friends have been inviting me to eat/hang out with them during those past months, but I had declined in a FRIENDLY way because I really did want to spend time with my family, since I barely get to see them. I even told them that I‚Äôve been excited to spend time with my family. That makes sense, right? Wanting to spend quality time with people you don‚Äôt see as often, especially if they‚Äôre your family?
Well, family has left and went back to their home, which is all the way across the other side of world. I‚Äôve been more free now and I thought my situation from the past few months was understandable and wasn‚Äôt a lame excuse, because I truly did cherish family time. Now, whenever the friends are in town, I noticed they barely even acknowledge me or ask if I want to hang out, constantly posting that they‚Äôre out (which I used to be with them before family visitation). I had spent time with my friends a couple of time even when I was busy, but often had to decline due to spending time with family; my friends knew that. One of my best friends is also in that group, but it seems that she is leaning more on her other friends for enjoyment. 
Now, I‚Äôm so confused and am thinking if my decision of just wanting to hang with my family, who lives so far in another country and I barely see, was a wrong decision in the eyes of my friends?

Most of them put out their review before they're even halfway through the game.

Sometimes the version of the game they review is not even the same as the release version, this is because game companies will often hide bad features from the critic to secure a good review from them. (i.e Gran Turismo 7).

I found out today,  from a licensed trauma therapist, that when someone tells you they are a sociopath, it may be one of the few times they are telling the truth.  They must be believed and you need to cut ties as quickly as possible,  for your safety. 

Sociopaths don't feel the shame or embarrassment the rest of us would if we were accused of having sociopathic traits. They literally are not capable of feeling most emotions,  although they are adept at mimicking them,  if they feel they can use emotion to gain an advantage over someone. 

In addition to not feeling shame or embarrassment about being a sociopath,  it's an indicator that you may become one of their victims,  if you aren't already.  Sociopaths freely admit they are a sociopath so they can later avoid taking responsibility for their actions.  The victim is then held responsible for the abuse they endured because ""they were warned"" and ""allowed"" the abuse to happen.  

Taking responsibility for their actions or feeling remorse for hurting others is outside the capabilities of sociopaths.  They literally are unable to feel empathy.  So even though they may acknowledge they have hurt you,  they don't care. They are always looking for a personal benefit or advantage and have no issues destroying another person if it benefits them.  

Pay attention to language, as it may be an indicator.  For example,  a sociopath may say ""I apologize"" when they have harmed someone.  But they will not say ""I'm sorry"" for the actions that harmed their victim.  Although it may take someone a bit to catch on,  there is a difference in the two phrases. I apologize is a statement &amp; they feel that is adequate enough to pacify someone.  However,  I'm sorry indicates they are taking responsibility for their actions that caused harm.  Although they're capable of telling people what they think they want to hear and excel at lying,  even a simple statement like I'm sorry can be nearly impossible because they don't accept responsibility and they don't actually feel remorse.","LPT: If someone tells you they are a sociopath, believe them.

Since I was young I noticed when eating kiwi my mouth became tingly and there was a slight burning sensation. I thought nothing of this because other fruits like pineapple had a similar effect, and I learned that pineapple has a digestive enzyme (Bromelain) that basically breaks your mouth down. I figured something similar was happening with kiwi. 

I mentioned the burning to one of my friends and they agreed with pineapple but said they had never experienced it with kiwi or any of the other things that made my mouth tingle like celery or peaches. An internet dive led me to oral allergy syndrome (OAS). 

Oral allergy syndrome is more common in people with seasonal allergies and the types of foods that cause the symptoms match your allergies (ie there are different sensitivities if you are allergic to grass, birch, or ragweed). Some people describe a tingly sensation like me, others describe an itching or burning. Some people with ragweed allergies also have this effect from certain edibles. 

The tingling goes away if you cook the fruit/veggies. There is no treatment for OAS and as long as the sensation isn‚Äôt too unpleasant for most of the allergens you can just keep enjoying.

Jameteed50,t2_1cn49h,1648007165.0,"As an adult, I think it's important to cultivate something called ""Win Management"", or ""Success Management"". It's basically another way of saying ""being humble."" Humility is one of those unspoken skills we build as people, and a form of emotional IQ.  I feel it goes hand in hand with building confidence in your life as well as building security within yourself. 

As we get older, we may get more wins under our belt. By ""Wins"" I mean achievements that you KNOW would impress people on some level if they knew. Say for example, you get a really nice car, or a nice job/career.  Maybe you've recently lost of weight, etc.  Although it may seem like common knowledge, just carry yourself like you've been there before.  

For example, say some guy recently gets a Lamborghini.  He goes on a date and all he talks about is how great his car is. Then the other person says ""He is too cocky"". What  they really mean is the person tried too hard to use his ""wins in life"" as a means to get people to like him. The guy is basically conveying the message, ""I need you to know I drive that Lambo in order for you to like me and respect me."" Same could be applied for any similar ""high accomplishment(s)"".  

Carry yourself like you don't need to rely on that ""win"" as a crutch to have people like you and respect you. Carry yourself like you don't need to flaunt your wins in someone's face, as if your putting all your eggs into that basket to get people to like you. Let your personality and vibe do that work. Of course, if it gets brought up, talk about that; but don't feel like everything has to ride on your ""wins"" otherwise you are not enough. There's more to your story than that.

Now I'm NOT saying that you shouldn't work hard in life. It's VERY important to elevate ourselves in this life and to take your life VERY seriously because honestly no one else will. Getting more ""wins"" in life is good. But when you get those wins, remember to be tactful and socially aware enough to not feel the need to shove it in people's faces, and move with grace. The more you excel in life, the more you won't even feel the need to flaunt those achievements. I'm not just talking external achievements, but also in loving yourself and developing security with who you are over time.

One revelatory skosh of info in the podcast is that excess salt can cause a post-meal crash. He states that salt is ""hidden"" in many processed foods. Since it's hidden by other flavors our taste buds don't trigger thirst. In turn, this leads to an excess of salt in your body, which causes fatigue as your body struggles to process it. 

Check out these **average daily allowances of sodium** in common foods: 

* 1/2 Digorno supreme pizza: 124% 
* Chicken top ramen: 69% 
* McDonald's Big Mac: 44%
* Marie Callendar's Chicken Pot Piet: 41% 
* Campbell's Chicken Noodle Soup: 39% 

Add to these foods, sides of fries, salt for seasoning, and you may be getting a ton of salt in just once sitting.

The Department of Transportation figures show that under-inflated tires waste about 5 million gallons of gas *every day* in the United States.

The U.S. Department of Energy says that for every 1 psi missing from your car‚Äôs set of 4 tires, you lose 0.1 percent of your gas mileage. (Every psi lost also means that tires wear 10 percent faster.)

By properly inflating your tires, you can improve your gas mileage by up to 3.3 percent. This means that cars getting 30 mpg could see a benefit of about 1 mpg with properly inflated tires. 

This benefit seems small at first, but when combined with tire savings this amounts to a significant sum over time.

meshtron,t2_q1m1oms,1647924825.0,"First job out of school, I was the college-nerd engineer in a rough, union manufacturing facility.  I learned a lot from those days.  One lesson that has stuck with me in the decades since then, and that I have shared countless times with people who I worked with and then who worked for me was this tip.

A guy - we'll call him Jack - was the Maintenance Lead at my plant.  A big, burly, bearded mountain of a guy with a deep voice who was the local union president.  Good guy.  He busted my chops hard but I finally earned a grudging respect from him.  Every time I'd see him I'd ask ""How's it goin, Jack?""  Every time he'd answer ""It doesn't get any better than this!"" with a smile obvious though but hidden behind his prodigious facial hair.

One day I advanced this banter a little further and said ""Man Jack - you always give that same positive answer.  Do you really believe that or do you just want me to shut up and go away?""  He feigned an emotionally hurt look and said I could take solace in knowing if he didn't want me to talk to him, I would never need to wonder about it.

What he said next, though, was the real nugget.  He explained to me that he had barely graduated high school.  Never been good at math, never cared much for reading and didn't get along well with most people because most people are assholes.  And yet, here he was with a 40-hour a week job, owned his own house, had the respect of his peers, interesting people to talk to, and very little stress to deal with.  He said it LITERALLY didn't get any better than THIS JOB, FOR HIM.  He further explained that if he ever thought maybe it should or could get better, it would damn well be on him to explore that and go find out.  Not listen to what his sister's husband told him, not believe what the other union guys were saying about how much better some other job was, but go get it - do it - live it to know if it really was better.  And, for him, he couldn't imagine many ways - with his skills, desires, and values - to be doing much better than he was.  So, he came in every day.  Early.  Made coffee.  And answered anyone who asked how he was doing with ""It doesn't get any better than this.""

It comes up most often for me in work conversations, but I think the gist of the advice is broader than that.  Here are my takeaways:

* Every one of us has finite limits on what we're capable of
* It is possible - even likely - that consistently operating at those limits of capability does not necessarily align with what you'd LIKE to be spending your time on
* It's up to each of us, individually, to work out the math on what the right balance is for us and seek it
* This equation often changes over time, adjust accordingly
* If you THINK you can do better, go effing find out.  There is risk to taking that leap, but every spec of energy you spend on believing you should be doing better is wasted as resentment against actually taking action and finding out
   * Don't talk about it; be about it

I think this advice applies to relationships, personal health, financial freedom, etc.  The principles are similar.  Spend your energy on first understanding what success looks like to you, second on working towards that, finally on making sure you maintain that alignment.

Both my ex and her dad don't mind that I'm there for the time being, but it still feels weird.

Im not there every day of the week, it can fluctuate a lot, but I'm worried it might intervene with my healing process.

There aren't many other choices to live since I cant rent a home (too expensive and I dont earn money during my internship). I can maybe sleep in the hospital (my internship), but I think I really won't be happy sleeping there..

For example, you'll always start at the fruits and vegetables section. It makes you feel like you got the healthy food and then you allow yourself to buy more junk. Another one is that the entrance is usually on the left, because people are more likely to look right. So here are some quick tips:

1. Don't go shopping when you're hungry. Shops use the smell of bread and chocolate (usually from the bakery) to make you buy more food. 

2. If you don't need a lot of things, take a beg instead of a shopping cart. 

3. Create a shopping list and arrange it according to the store's sections (as much as you can). Avoid entering to sections that you don't need to go to. 

4. Look above and below you. Usually the most popular/expensive products will be right in front of your eyes. 

5. Compare prices base on both the price and weight. Don't be afraid to buy unknown brand. In many cases, the food will taste the same. 

6. Sometimes ordering online can be a better option because you don't need to face many of those tricks, and it is easier to compare prices.

Sometimes I can't tell if he's trying to sound smart/interesting or if he's genuinely curious/insightful haha...you tell me, but here's the ""subjecting myself to boredom"" mindfulness exercise:

For many, from a meditative view, boredom is a lapse in paying attention. So, you subject yourself to it for psychological growth.. one day, to start, I looked over tax returns for a long time with bland breakfast. Then I went to a really busy post office to mail, just to endure the long lines without my phone or even positive anticipation, like you have at theme parks. Went to the DMV right afterwards for more errands. Nothing but emotional coldness, bureaucracy, mindless paperwork. Finished by visiting an elderly relative who I love, but who recycles the same two stories in excruciating detail...

With more meditation, boredom is still a tyrant of the mind, but a much less powerful one. As David Foster Wallace said in The Pale King, ‚ÄúRoutine, repetition, tedium, monotony, ephemeracy, inconsequence, abstraction, disorder, boredom, angst, ennui ‚Äî these are the true hero's enemies, and make no mistake, they are fearsome indeed.

Hyppolit,t2_3t3oc2ei,1647803346.0," Hi all,

Sorry if this has been posted before, I tried looking for other posts but couldn't really find one that applies.

I bought a ticket with Spirit airlines on March 4th from LAX to San Juan Puerto Rico on for May 18th. There is a slight chance that I will not be able to make that flight, and have to delay for about a week. The problem is, I won't know until just the week before.

My question is, what is the best way for me to handle this? I'm not super familiar with flight change and cancellation policies, and I'm having a hard time interpreting the information.

Would my best option be to wait and change the flight, or should I try and book a second ticket and cancel the one I don't need? What are the factors I need to consider? If this is not something that can easily be answered like this, how can I go about finding out what's the best option?

Many of us start our day by immediately checking our phones, then get ready for work or school, then spend all day working or learning, conversing with peers and colleagues, doing chores and errands, and when we get breaks and downtime, we immediately fill them with reading news, scrolling social media, and watching television.

When was the last time you truly had no distractions and were able to just be alone with your thoughts? When was the last time you were neither doing some sort of productive task nor consuming some sort of entertainment? Even a walk in the park is commonly injected with entertainment by listening to music or podcasts.

Many people use formal meditation to attain some quiet reflection, but lots of less formal activities will work too. For instance:

* Taking a walk
* Cuddling your pet
* Going to the gym (and not listening to music or watching television)
* Eating a meal alone
* Driving to or from work (if it's an easy peaceful drive without traffic)
* Cooking an uncomplicated, easy meal alone
* Doing a low-stress hobby, like knitting or fishing

Applying ice to the surface doesn't tend to get it cold enough, and a freezer takes a long while and once it is out of the freezer for a while it heats up again so you often have to do it over and over again before you get an optimal result. 

C02 in a can, used for cleaning dust out of computers and other tight spaces, generally has a liquid propellant in it that becomes super cold when sprayed out of the can. If you use the can as directed, only the air comes out, but if you turn the can upside down, the liquid comes out and freezes anything it touches. 

Instead of putting your item of clothing in the freezer for an hour or more, simply spray the liquid onto the area the gum is stuck to and it will freeze it instantly, making it way easier to scrape off in a shorter amount of time. You can do this repeatedly until as much gum as possible is removed. The entire process takes about 5 minutes.

WARNING: Be sure to wear multiple pairs of rubber gloves so that you don't give yourself frostbite, and do this in a well ventilated space so that you do not inhale the propellant.

What I'm referring to is small, friendly favours. Let me give some examples. Say you have a really friendly neighbor who you're on really good terms with. His garage is bordering your back yard and he wants to expand it can fit his new car. He either cannot do it on his property or it would make it much easier if he could expand it from the back (so he wouldn't have to deal with the murder-door-spring).  You're really good buddies, its in the back corner, only 2ft over the line, doesn't bother you, you say yes. Then after five years he sells his property to some real assholes and they decide that since a garage is clearly a more permanent structure, your fence is clearly on their property and you have to move it. Ensue bothersome proceedings and cost.

It could easily be avoided with a simple contract. ""I, the owner of xyz, allow my neighbor John Smith to expand his garage into my property by so much and he and all future owners acknowledge that it is on my property and agree to remove the part that is on my property within a month of receiving a written notice to do so"".

Or, they can't fit their new RV on their property that is bordering your huge field. They ask if they can park it there. Or they want to renovate something and it would be much easier for the builders to access it from your property and they ask for temporary access. Again, a contract, clearly stating what, where and when. You, my dear cousin, can park your RV across the street from your front yard. You, dear neighbor can drive some equipment over my property for the duration of work. If not clearly defined, such temporary arrangements have a nasty habit of becoming permanent and even expanding. Your cousin could park there and so the new owner assumes he can park his three extra trucks on your field. It came with the property. They could access their back yard over your property, surely I can now drive over it whenever I want.

Of course, the best thing to do in such cases is to just sell the land. But sometimes it is really temporary or the other person doesn't have the money or maybe you don't want to sell. If it ever comes to a situation like this, write a contract and get it notarized. It can save you a lot of headaches in the future. And before you think that stuff like this doesn't happen. It does.

jayellkay84,t2_3yadsvwu,1647654060.0,"Coming from a discussion with a coworker today. I live in Hurricane country and it continues to boggle my mind that people buy a few extra cans of creamed corn and call it their emergency rations. You may be without power for a while and it may be a while longer before you can get real food again. A can of creamed corn a day isn‚Äôt going to keep you full or satisfied. 

My current stockpile as a single person (I rotate through and replace), which I hope to last at least a week if needed:

1. At least 2 16 packs of toaster pastries. I eat these daily for breakfast anyway. 

2. Bread and peanut butter. I always have an unopened backup. 

3. Canned beans (and I‚Äôm not talking green beans but more like black/kidney/garbanzo and similar) are my main canned staple. They provide protein and slow digesting carbs and will keep you fuller longer. I keep about 10 cans on hand. 

4. Canned tomatoes pair well with the beans and often come seasoned. 10 cans. 

5. A couple cans of peas, green beans, mushrooms and pineapple for variety. Probably only 10 cans total. 

6. Canned meats (chicken and tuna, though salmon/sardines/spam would fall in this category). Again about 10 cans. Protein will keep you full. 

7. Single serving fruit cups. Remember you may not have anywhere to keep your opened cans from going bad. 2 4-packs. 

6. Granola bars, dry cereal, dried fruits and chips/pretzels/cookies. I don‚Äôt keep a set number but they are on hand. 

7. When the power comes on and you can cook again, you may very well be sick of canned food, but the grocery store hasn‚Äôt restocked and restaurants that are open may be crowded. So, some boxed pasta/rice/other pantry food that requires cooking but not refrigeration is nice to have on hand. 

8. Seasoning. Hot sauce. Packets of salad dressing that don‚Äôt need refrigeration. Salt and pepper. You don‚Äôt want to eat bland food. Prepare now so you won‚Äôt suffer then. 

The longest my power has ever personally been out was 4 days for Hurricane Irma, but you never know. And don‚Äôt wait for a storm to approach either. Start buying a few cans now.

I went to the #1 ranked program in the country in my discipline for graduate school and went to a top 20 program as an undergraduate. People think that the only places you can get a truly excellent education is at one of the top-tier universities in the country. This is not true, and I will tell you why:

Who is teaching you? Professors, of course. How do they become professors? By getting a PhD from a university. This has unexpected implications.

Take a look at the faculty in your major at, let's say, Dartmouth College. You'll see that the faculty all got their PhDs at prestigious institutions -- Harvard, Stanford, Columbia, UCLA, etc.

So you would think, then, that if you are someone who got your PhD at, let's say, UPenn or Harvard, you would end up teaching at a place like Yale or MIT or Cornell, etc.

Nope.

The vast majority of PhDs who come from these high-ranking institutions end up teaching at more middling places: University of Kansas, Lehigh University, Kenyon College, UC-Riverside, etc. Now, it is \*also\* true that a few of them will end up at those top tier places, but this is the exception, not the rule.

Why?

Because there are way, way more graduates of the top-tier PhD programs than there universities at which they can be hired. Imagine a single graduation year, where the top 15 schools each produce 5 PhD graduates. That's 75 people looking for a job. But in a given year, it is unlikely that those 15 schools are hiring any more than 1 new professor. So you'll have 15 of those 75 getting jobs at other top-15 universities -- and the other 60 have to find jobs elsewhere.

So why does all this matter?

If you go to, let's say, Penn State -- a good but not great school -- and take a quick look at the chemical engineering faculty -- you'll find people from MIT, UC Berkeley, etc.

Ok, so?

At almost ANY of the top 120 or so colleges and universities in the country, you will find either some or MANY faculty with absolutely top tier backgrounds. You can find absolutely fabulous faculty at almost any university. The key is that you have actually to show up in office hours, ask them questions, discuss your interests with them, etc. These are people with PhDs, from the best universities in the country, who have been conducting research for years. Absolutely any thought you've ever had about their discipline is likely a thought they have had as well -- this means it is possible to have conversations about things that are enlightening in ways you never thought possible. They will sharpen your thinking, your critical analysis skills, your writing, broaden your worldview, etc.

So rather than agonize over the academic reputation of this place or that, or whether this place or that will ""get you a job"" (that has much more to do with getting an internship while you're in college and doing career-relevant volunteer work), pick a college that \*feels right\* to you. A place where you like the setting, a place you can afford without taking on insane amounts of debt, a place where the people feel like your people, where the kinds of student activities and organizations appeal to you, etc. College is going to cost your 4 years of your life. If you put effort into your experience there, you will get an absolutely top tier education at almost any top 100 university, as they are filled with top-tier brained people, for the most part.

thedrunkenrebel,t2_lkrc6mg,1647580385.0,"When i applied for a factory job i was told i will learn stuff on the go.

That's actually a massive red flag because it means:

1. Nobody can be bothered to teach new employees full procedures, either because they're not paid to aid others or because nobody actually knows the full process. When working in a factory there are so many processes and workflows and so many people responsible for their own part of these processes. Rarely a single person knows everything.

2. There aren't any theory resources to learn on your own besides actually doing it because the work hours are either stressful, the staff is burnt out, or there's only old staff with practically no worker turnaround, meaning everyone eventually learned their part and there's no longer any need to write manuals, for which the boss won't pay. Also, nobody made learning material for free, which means a bored and even toxic work environment where everyone does what's theirs and doesn't help their peers because they're not paid extra.

3. Months will pass before you'll eventually have a solid grasp on how to actually do all aspects of your job. You'll learn bits from everyone and figure new shit out daily, for too long before being able to fully understand how stuff should work and what are the priorities. Also, being the new guy in a staff of old people as mentioned before would mean everyone will ask you for help with anything to *teach you* but actually they'll use you to do their job.

1. The average American is sitting on over $100 of unused gift cards/store credit. Gather up all the cards in your household &amp; do a balance check on them. Write down the value on each card &amp; come up with a plan to use them. Or you can sell unused/unwanted cards to site like CardCash or Raise for money!

Millennials are statistically the worst at making use of gift cards/store credit. Make sure you get on it!

2. Check your email inboxes for any e-gift cards you may have received over the years, but forgot about. Just search for ‚Äúgift card‚Äù at the top of your inbox &amp; see what comes up. Do a balance check on all the cards you find. Delete the ones with $0 so they‚Äôre out of the way &amp; plan to spend/sell those that do have a balance

This is kind of like finding money in your pants on laundry day. It‚Äôs a nice surprise &amp; every little bit helps

3. Call up your bank(s) &amp; credit card companies. Ask them if they can refund any fees (ATM or monthly service) &amp; interest charges

I did this with Wells Fargo &amp; got some money returned

Discover will refund 3 interest charges every 12 months, as well as some ATM fees. They can look at statements from as far back as 7 years to find/return a fee or interest charge

Just call your credit card company &amp; ask them to see what they are able to do for you!

4. Bring your coins to the bank (or local grocery store if they have a coin counter) &amp; exchange them for cash. Some of us are sitting on a lot of coins. I have a close friend who had almost $75 in coins he recently traded in. He used the money on his grocery bill that day. This is win-win as banks &amp; retailers are often short on coins these days

I really wanted to start reading for years but couldn‚Äôt until I found the right book. I think the key is to think about your top three hobbies or interests then find short 200 or so page nonfiction books about those topics. Two of my favorite things are basketball and renewable energy/environmentalism so I tried a biography on my favorite basketball player and a book by David Attenborough that was half memoir on creating the nature documentary field and half about climate change. You‚Äôre obviously interested in those topics and reading about them is kind of like watching a documentary on your favorite thing but on steroids (along with relieving anxiety and exercising your brain) Once you get past those first couple books you will get better at it. Your attention span will lengthen and those nightly reading habits will develop in a way that will allow you to branch out into longer books about new topics.

I have been working for my current company for 4 years with a 6 month leave after the first 2 years (left to work at another company before getting an offer from my old manager).

LaserGecko,t2_ate0o,1647518478.0,"""What tooth supposedly needs a crown?"" 

That's what my friend who became a dentist asked me when I went to him for a second opinion. 

My old dentist retired and sold his practice to a young dentist. He bought all kinds of new equipment, including a Cerac machine and scanner for making crowns in the office. 

Lucky for me, I suddenly needed a crown!

Yet, for some reason, he didn't show me a photo of the damaged tooth. *cue the spidey senses*

I made an appointment with my friend who had bought his own practice. The dental assistant took some x-rays, he examined me, and asked ""What tooth supposedly needs a crown?""

I told him the general area and he said ""Dude, there's not even the start of a cavity there. No cracks. Nothing. Those teeth are 100% as perfect as can be for being almost fifty years old.""

Of course, Yelp removed the review I left for the old dentist where I stated that a Cerac machine sitting idle on the counter was not earning its keep. He also threatened to sue me for the wording of a few other phrases. 

Eventually, I replaced it with something like ""a Cerac machine is a very high tech Computer Aided Manufacturing machine capable of milling blocks of material into crowns for your teeth after the dentist produces a 3D scan. A dental lab that makes zero crowns in a month does not cost your dentist any money. The Cerac system probably costs more than your car. 

I do not know if the company allows the dentist to skip that month's payments if no patients need crowns, but that seems unlikely to me.""

That still pissed him off, but *fuck that guy who was going to destroy a healthy tooth for no fucking reason*.

By law, you are required to use a lock that *only you* have the key to, which means it *cannot* be a TSA-approved lock with the master key.

TSA will take your bag aside after check-in, but will typically have you watch as they inspect your bag before sending it on to the airline. However, it will not be opened again until you take possession after baggage claim.

During summer, the sun-rays become more powerful, hence the body feels as if squeezed with increasing atmospheric temperature. This in turn weakens the Kapha and strengthens vata day by day. Therefore proper diet and regimens should be followed in order to tackle the hot summer.

RECOMMENDED DIET FOR SUMMER:

Those with madhura rasa(sweet taste), laghu(light), snighdha(unctuos), and sita(cool) properties.
As the powerful summer sun-rays dries up the water content, more liquid intake is recommended.
Sakthu( powder of parched paddy or barley) mixed with sugar can be taken.
Polished sali rice( variety of red paddy rice) can be taken along with the meat of jangala animals (those residing in arid locales).
Rasa(meat soup), which is not much thick, Rasala (churned spicy curd), Raga(variety of soft drink prepared with dravyas having sweet, sour and salt tastes), Khandava(special type of soft drinks prepared with dravyas having sweet,sour,salt and astringent taste), Panakam or panchasaram( soft drink prepared with honey, dates, grapes, black currant and sugar) etc. can be prepared with thin slices of banana and jack fruit, stored in brand new clay pot and turned a little sour can be used to drink, served in earthen mug.
Cool water flavored with trumpet flower and camphor powder will also serve as drink.

panic_in_church,t2_bfk8iues,1647450278.0,"When we think of self-care we usually think of bubble baths and disney movies in bed. Nah, screw that. Think about self-care in a preventative sense that will positively affect different aspects of your life. As someone who has been diagonsed with major depression and generalized anxiety disorder, this practices also has helped me heal from those issues and help fight back against executive dysfunction.

Without breaking the rules the best I can, here are some examples that have personally helped me a lot. Of course, always consult the professionals for advice and not some rando on the internet:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Find a PCP (Primary Care Provider), a therapist, a dentist, a chiropractor, and any other professional and visit them on a frequency as suggested by them that you are able. Just a consultation/check-up once can do a lot for you, if money/time is an issue. Use the appointment times wisely and ask them about ways to improve your health and quality of life. Catching problems now will help you so much in the future. (Example, I found out I had 3 cavities from just a one-time dentist checkup! We got them fixed way before I ever needed to get a root canal or the teeth removed.)
2. Have a consistent, restorative morning and night routine. This could consist of brushing your teeth, skincare, stretches, some sort of meditative practice, or anything else you want to incorporate to improve your quality of life. And most importantly, GET SLEEP.
3. Get a gym membership and go, even if you‚Äôre only doing 30 minute workouts‚Ä¶. or have a consistent home workout schedule. If you can, schedule a monthly massage (if there is anything you take away from this, GET MASSAGES). Your body is the only one you have and it‚Äôs best to take care of it.
4. Learn more about your finances and take care of your financial health. Make a budget. Get an emergency fund. Get a Roth IRA or equivalent and max it out each year. Check out places like Fidelity where you can do this but also get financial advising. Build healthy credit by opening a credit card, turning on autopay, and only putting low-cost subscriptions on it. Alot of self-care (in the US, anyways) unfortunately require money and you want to be able to afford it.
5. Remember that the quality of your life is more important than trying to ‚Äúlook cool‚Äù or ‚Äútough,‚Äù and it‚Äôs definitely a lot more important to spend money on the quality of your life than for example, a video game or new fashion. It‚Äôs not cool to brag about how much pain you are in. Trust me, you‚Äôre not getting a shiny medal for pulling your 3rd all-nighter in a row.
6. Do a consumption detox on a regular basis. What you consume will affect your quality of life. Dump toxic friends, resist the urge to doom scroll, and consume media that makes you happy, not miserable. Of course, stay informed about news and important things, but make sure you aren‚Äôt consumed by it.
7. Somewhat related to that, do your chores, as much as you and I hate them. Having a healthy and clean environment does wonders for your well-being.

With wages and inflation being as they are, some of these self-care practices are a lot harder to do for some (most) people financially. It‚Äôs also definitely harder for minors who are not independent yet and may be in toxic households(trust me, I‚Äôve been there). However, healthy habits everyday can still apply while being free. Remember that home workouts, mindfulness, journaling, budgeting, chores, friendships, etc. are all free.

Also as a disclaimer, this is not the magical fix for any problem and some problems require addressing  it directly first to improve your life (abusive relationships, as an example). This LPT is merely a way to \*improve\* yourself and your situation and give you a better chance at being happier. You deserve happiness regardless if you don‚Äôt do any of this or all of it.

1. Save your W2s, all of them, for at least 2 years.

2. Save your paystubs, but not any and all of them. Especially if you get commissions or overtime or bonuses, you will want to save the last paystub of the year that shows all the year-to-date earnings broken down by category. Also the last paystub at an employer. Also if you got an especially big commission/bonus/etc. At least 2 years' worth.

3. If you're self employed or 1099, keep your entire tax return, every single page, every single schedule. For at least 2 years, if not more. Most people will have digital copies but some people never get a digital copy from their accountants and they might have a hard time locating it for you or be ""too busy"" when you need them.

4. If you have any court orders that has to do with marriage/divorce/child support (going in and going out)/judgments/liens/bankruptcies/etc. save them indefinitely. ""Hey, you had this one lien/judgment on your record 10 years ago. Most likely gone now but we still need proof to triple check mmk?"" Is pretty common when you're trying to buy a house. Again. Every single page.

5. If you've owned/sold a home, documents pertaining to the purchase/sale of the home. Most people are good about keeping this but sometimes, if you were on the title for, let's say, your parents' house, and you weren't involved much in the sale, you might not have anything. But if you were on title, that means you might be asked for documentation for one reason or another. Same goes for title transfers like Quit Claim Deeds.

6. Proof of sale for cars, boats, other taxable vehicles. In case the new owner never does the proper paperwork and you end up owing taxes that turn into judgments for something you sold and now need to prove to remove the judgment.

7. Employment contract/offer letter/promotion letter if you change jobs and want to buy before you've established history at that new job. It's a hassle at some employers, to get that stuff again, especially in food service, construction, manufacturing, most blue collar jobs, small businesses etc.

These are all I can think of off the top of my head. Feel free to bring up more in the comments if you have personal experiences.

‚ÄúThis is very true.

In my former career, someone once asked me why I charge so much for my daily rate when I could lower the daily rate and switch to hourly to get more work and thus advance my career.

My answer was that I‚Äôd much rather work less often and get paid more than work more often and get paid less.

Charging daily got me paid the same amount if I worked a full 8 hours, or as often the case was, fucking around for 6 and getting everything finished in 2 (though, to be fair, there were seldom occasions where the work spanned more than 8 hours).

It was a great career and occasionally, I miss some parts of it.‚Äù","[LPT] Work diligently to charge for a days worth of your time at a high rate, instead of a lower one at an hourly rate. Your career will not suffer for it.",LifeProTips,False,1.0,1.0,1.0

MO_drps_knwldg,t2_9ci33rgu,1647389326.0,"Until about four years ago, my previous positions were very analytical in nature and were centered around written reports and communication. I rarely had to verbally convey information to large groups.

When I took on a new position, I was required to be a cross-location meeting leader and primary presenter for a group of about 60 attendees. In addition, I was required to lead smaller weekly and bi-weekly calls

At first, this was nerve wracking, given my lack of speaking experience. What made the difference was focusing on the needs of my audience, rather than worrying about what their perception of me as presenter would be:

- Focus on providing a service to your audience, rather than being self focused.

- Know your material inside and out. If you have your material down, and speak to the audience instead of reading, you will already have achieved much of your objective

- Realize the audience isn‚Äôt judging you as much as you think. If you are engaging, they will be focused on the content and have questions or want additional information

I wish I had been forced out of my comfort zone earlier in life. The effect that consistent public speaking has had on my confidence can‚Äôt be overstated. When you are able to face one of the most intimating social circumstances on regular basis and excel, every day social interactions will not seem intimating.

dochoiday,t2_79f5e,1647381750.0,"If you are bringing in your car to a dealership for service and repairs chances are you are getting ripped off. This applies primarily to Domestic and Japanese cars in the US. (Ford, Chevy, Toyota, Honda etc.) if you have European car your situation is a little different.

Your typical car dealership is going to charge 5-20% more for labor and parts as opposed to a local mechanic. On top of that they are more than likely to bill you for unnecessary things (although any mechanic will do this) like ""fluid Checks"" and ""tune ups"". These ""checks"" are total BS because you do not need to pay a mechanic to find issues on your car, they will do that for free (and often times its not broken). these are added in to make it seem like they are doing a lot of work and how they can get away with charging you $500 for a service that should really only cost $250. ""tune ups"" on the other hand are them spraying what is essentially a $5 can of sea foam in your air intake and billing you $50 for it. assuming they even do that.

(European car owners this doesn't necessary apply to you) However just because they are a ______ dealer doesn't mean they know how to work on the car better, this comes back to finding a trusted mechanic, If anything a good mechanic is going to do a much better job fixing your car than a dealership would.

The best thing to do is ask around/do a yelp or google search and find a well reviewed mechanic that has a reputation for being honest and doing good work. You want to look for the Jim's auto repair that your friend takes his car too and has 100's of legit positive reviews on google. You do not want to go to one of the large chains (Goodyear, Jiffy Lube, Mr. Tire, etc.) those places are whole different story of don't go.

As well don't be afraid to negotiate or say no. are they saying your brake fluid needs to be changed? probably BS. have you noticed your car is squealing like a banshee when you brake and they say you need new pad and rotors? probably true. a good way to negotiate as well is just to simply ask. They tell you its going to be $1,000 for that repair you need? just ask them what they can do for you on the price, worst they will tell you is no.

Finally, get a basic understanding of what your car needs. do not rely on the person billing you, telling you what needs to be done. your vehicles service intervals will be in your owners manual, refer to that as opposed to the dealership clerk.

If you own a European car, that's a much more difficult situation. Your best bet is to apply the above concepts just in hopes you can find a mechanic that can work on European cars without messing it up.

This was a lot of details but I hope it helps, in short the only work you should have done at a dealer is the work that's covered under warranty.","LPT, Unless it's covered under warranty, DO NOT bring your car to a dealership for service or repairs.

Also note this is what kids naturally do till they hit puberty or so. There are a few adults who keep it up but most of us forget how it's done. Let's look at some examples to explore how this works:

1. Languages 
- put post-its around your house with the names of the objects attached on the BACK. Every day you get the name right without looking, you add one notch to the post-it. At 7 notches, you take the post-it down. Try to remove all the post-its from the room as fast as possible! 
- try to make silly rhymes, acronyms, or stories that contain key parts of grammar rules

2. Any performative skill (drawing, juggling, wood working)
- do a competition with a friend! Every day you create something and first person who misses a day, loses the wager. Or maybe you assign each other a topic each day and see where it goes!

3. Any science-related skill
- design a magic system around full control of whatever principle you are learning 
- find a buddy to trade puzzles with. Every puzzle uses the principles you are trying to learn.

You can also go in reverse - a lot of games already teach loads of skills!

- run an MMORPG guild to practice management skills.
- first person shooters train spatial cognition and perceptual attention
- any text-heavy game (often RPGs) will improve your language ability.

I see a lot of people joke about marrying someone and being the ""trophy wife"" or ""house husband"" for someone wealthy, but... they don't really delve into this.   


I have had the luck recently to test out what I had figured out on my own on this topic, income disparity in couples, and it was fascinating. I had met an attractive woman on The League, a dating app for career minded folks. I read her profile wrong and was like, ""well, I've dated a few lawyers, we could get along"" thinking she might make more than me, but not so big a discrepancy that would make it weird.....  


well.....  


I missed the line where it said clearly they were in the top C Suite for a ridiculously huge and well known, bonkers rich, company. This came up about a week in, we'd been messaging back and forth multiple times a day, and I was always looking forward to hearing from them. So I suggested we text. They said that they would be glad to give me that number in person, but that was just to make sure I was a human. I was already quite sure this person was real, and local to me, and we even knew the same features of our favorite Trader Joe's. If this had happened in reverse, I'd actually be more skeptical. I bounce this awkward development off my BFF, and they're like, ""duh, I'd be  the same if I (had that job)"".... ""Lawyer?"" &lt;looks&gt; oh shit.  


So.... I got stoned and started the conversation, asking if it had been an issue for them in the past? ""Yes, of course... I was wondering the same about you?""  


I parlayed how I had dealt in the past with this, moving in with my ex-spouse (then fianc√©) many years ago and I was the primary bread winner and the system we came up with that we both felt was fair and wouldn't put a major strain on us. We lived together without a single fight in 10 years, and even the divorce was kinda cute. But things got weird when for maaaaybe a year, they were making more than me for once. We just had grown to have different priorities.  


One really interesting thing I didn't expect: this person had fertility goals, including genetic screening already in play! The majority of my life, I have thought I could never afford this way on my own, and would have to adopt... I have a rare syndrome and don't want my own kids to have a childhood full of illness and surgeries. And here is someone I already like, feel understood and heard by, that's not only willing, but able to go on that journey.  


Now, let's look at this another way. The more common way. The income disparity conversation doesn't happen before cohabitation, or even marriage... there's so much to navigate that can shock people new to this. Could you have a spouse in debt $100k and with a 420 credit score that is perfectly happy with the same job that covered all their bills in the past.... or a spouse that has no student debt, no car payments, and does really well because they own an income property their folks financed for them, but has never had a common service industry job?

Se2Ep3,t2_1hevskdu,1647300408.0,"I decided to make this guide for every girl who has any guys around, not only husbands and boyfriends, but just friends, dads, brothers and colleagues.

1. Have tissues in your bathroom - Even if you live alone, buy some tissues or even just a few spare rolls of paper towels, and keep them in your bathroom. It may happen, that there is a party at your place or someone simply comes over and gets an unexpected stiffy (sometimes they come outta nowhere, it just happens) - just let the guys know that you have their back in that case. You can tell them discreetly or just have a box marked ""you know what this is you filthy fucking animal"" in a visible place in your bathroom.  
2. Emergency tissue or paper towel in your car glove box is okay - doesn't take much space, can save someones day.  
3. Every guy experiences stiffies differently, so if you only experienced a guy that is acting normal, able to go jogging every morning and feeling all right with a stiffy, don't say anything like ""you should be ashamed of yourself"" or ""maybe go see a doctor"", or ""you're scaring me Kevin"" when you see a guy who says he's very weak and feeling awful, suffering from intrusive thoughts.  
4. If you are close with the guy, ask him about his stiffy preferences - some guys prefer to stay at home and jerk it in private, some prefer staying active and powering through, trying not to let it interfere with their day. Some guys crave salty foods, some crave chocolates. Just felt like mentioning that for some reason. Ask him if he uses any specific vasodilators to get a stiffy, or muscle relaxers to lose them, and buy them to have at your place.
5. If you want to have any pills to help with horrifying sexual scenes playing out in one's mind without reprieve, give up, because they don't exist. Instead, look for something to serve as a distraction. You can ask a Dick's Sporting Goods clerk, they will help you.
6. If you notice that a guy has a wet spot on his pants, tell him discreetly. Offer your jacket if you can, so he can tie it around his waist and at least cover the stain. Or just point and laugh because he deserves it, the sick freak.
7. If a guy with a stiffy stays overnight, you should lock him in a room with something to hump. Stuffed animals come in handy! Or you can just leave a few rolls of paper towels so he can come in handy - that way, if there is any leaking, it won't stain your floor.
8. If there is a cum stain, good luck finding it. But if you do find some crunchy carpet, cover it with baking soda and spray vinegar on it. Let it sit for a few seconds, remove, repeat if needed. You can scrub a bit with an old toothbrush or other brush. When the stain is gone, you can rub some softener in that place so it doesn't smell of vinegar, but it's not obligatory as the smell will be gone after an hour or something.
9. Guy may cry for ""no reason"" - he saw an attractive woman on TV and his head filled with a bunch of dirty stuff and he felt powerless to control this curse and an incurable shame in knowing that if anyone could peer inside his head for three seconds he'd be sentenced to life in prison - boom, he's sobbing. Don't say anything like ""this is not a reason to cry, stop acting like a baby"". He is probably aware that this is a stupid reason, he just can't fight his filthy sex-obsessed mind acting like that. Better say that this woman is just an actor who was born beautiful, and she for sure got a belly rub after it was recorded and got a favourite snack.

So, with the disclaimer that everyone's period will vary, this is a basic template that most bodies follow.
Day 1 of a period starts when a woman bleeds.
The bleeding is a bit of blood mixed with the inner lining of the uterus.

2 weeks later, an egg is released from one of the ovaries. This is the time when it is most likely to get pregnant. Also, she will frequently but not now always have a clear stretchy eggwhite-like discharge at this time which helps the sperm swim to the egg.

If a sperm meets the egg, it will travel down the fallopian tube and implant in the now thickened uterine wall, resulting in a pregnancy. The due date is calculated 40 weeks from the FIRST day of her period before you even had sex. Shocker! It doesn't mean she cheated if she is 2 weeks more pregnant than when you had sex. Ask your doctor.

If the sperm does not reach the egg, the lining will slough off, fall out with some blood and the process starts all over again.

An average period is 28 days, but they vary wildly between women. Just because a woman has a typical 28 day period doesn't mean she ovulates on the same schedule. Some ovulate 3 weeks after their period and have difficulty staying pregnant because the uterus sheds before the pregnancy has a chance to establish itself.

Just because there is a predictable time when it is more likely a woman will get pregnant does not mean that she will not get pregnant at any other time. These are just guidelines the body follows. Ovaries and uteruses are bitches and love to fuck things up for us!

Bonus pro tip for anyone that missed this info because they were just so happy to get on the pill: ANTIBIOTICS USUALLY MAKE THE PILL INEFFECTIVE! Use a backup method any time antibiotics are used for the entirety of that cycle!

meyers_,t2_yb56d,1647289121.0,"Throughout your professional life, there will come a time when you have to leave a job. It can be a mix of emotions ‚Äì you may be sad to leave a place you‚Äôve been for years, you could be excited about a new experience and opportunity, or you might be looking to move on from an undesirable situation. 

Regardless of the circumstances, it‚Äôs always important to leave any position with dignity. Here are some tips:

* Give notice professionally: be courteous and communicate when your last day will be
* Be helpful: communicate that you're available during the transition
* Be positive: don't dwell on negatives; extend goodwill and wish colleagues the best
* Extend gratitude: say thank you for the opportunity

If you're leaving a job because the job itself (or culture, team, management, etc.) made you miserable, you might feel inclined to express your true feelings in a parting message or exit interview. Resist the urge.  Despite how cathartic it might feel now, expressing your true feelings after giving your notice won't do yourself any favors.

First, it's just not a good look. Take the high road; you're moving on and your focus should be on the positives rather than the negatives. (You've presumably already had an opportunity to voice your concerns, before you quit, so why do it now?)

Second, it's a small world, and you never know when someone from a past job might show up in your future. Try not to burn bridges.

WitherBones,t2_bt1jd,1647284466.0,"The last post I saw titled "" **LPT: Period guide for dudes** "" came off really condescending, and frankly did not read like it was written by a woman or by someone in the know. So, here's an actual ""Period Guide"" that won't get you dumped or treated like a psycho.  


1. Don't dismiss our emotions, ask us if we're on our period, or act like our hormones are the singular reason why we're upset about something. Hormones are why every one does everything - they're the chemicals your brain uses to control literally every single one of your survival impulses. If a woman is on her period, and reacting strongly to something, be it with sadness, anger, etc. those emotions are still being experienced by a real human being and should be respected. Whether someone is on their period or not, if something has upset them, the impact of having that emotion is the same, and kindness is just part of being polite.
2. Having a pain reliever around your house that is both a fever reducer and muscle relaxer is a great tip from the OP, so I'll include that here. This, along with telling a girl discreetly if you notice she's got a blood stain on her pants are legit good advice.
3. Every woman has a different period experience, and those experiences vary month to month for an individual. Some woman are so regular they could set a watch by them. Some women are so irregular they have no idea if it'll show up a week late, early, or worse. Some experience very little pain. Some experience debilitating pain. There are also a cluster of conditions that impact what kind of symptoms and to what severity a woman will experience. Don't shame someone for their period experiences just because every woman you've been close to before has had it a certain way.
4. Women don't always get a warning before their period starts, and no, they can't control when it does. This is a myth I have heard WAY too many men repeat and it's worth debunking, right up there with thinking the urethra and vagina are the same hole. They are different holes, and yes, a woman can pee just fine with a tampon in.
5. Don't treat someone differently just because they're on their period until they express a preference for it, because again, everyone has a different time riding that ride. I DO want my partner to expect me to nap more. I DO NOT want my partner treating me like I'm weak. That may be the opposite to another woman's preferences. A kind ""Is there anything I can do for you?"" when you notice the woman/women in your life having a difficult time with their symptoms can go a long way. Asking ""How do you want me to handle your period?"" comes off weird. Don't word this like a dork.
6. If you insist on keeping period products around your house or in your glove box, pads are the preference as tampons cant be used by everyone. DO NOT GET SCENTED STUFF! Go for ""Normal"" size and ""Winged"", which seems to have the widest audience. Please just be aware that this is going to make it look like you have a girlfriend so be prepared to answer that question. If you're keeping them in the glove box, keep them in a ziplock so they don't get dandruff and crud all over them. I also recommend having at least a small lidded trash bin with a liner in it for your bathroom.
7. The body reuses bits and pieces, chemically, for all sorts of stuff. A period is more or less the same stuff that's in a bloody nose. Don't treat it like it's some kind of diseased tissue or that you're going to die if it touches you or that you'll wither away if someone mentions their period/period symptoms around you. We're mammals just like you, not little porcelain sex dolls or some other abstract species that never farts. Our bodies do gross things just like yours do, and being shamed for it just damages that woman's relationship with you.

Just like when you don't share your successes with that one friend because they always one-up you, you don't want to tell jokes to a person who won't let you get through it or tries to make you feel bad for even trying. Don't be that person.

It's better to bite your tongue, wait until their joke is finished, and then offer one of your own (unless of course you are going to re-tell the same joke in a different way, in that case, see above). Some of the best times I've had with friends is when we tell joke after joke, especially when we can keep it on a similar topic.","LPT: If someone is telling a joke you've heard before, let them tell it.",LifeProTips,False,1.0,1.0,1.0

A lot of the meals we cook use broth (soup, stew, etc.) so instead of constantly making sure we had pre-made broth of chicken and beef in the house we moved to the Tone's bullion cubes and could be happier with substituting 1 cup broth with water and a bullion cube. 

Well, after finally making fresh tomato soup (best I've ever had) for the first time I was curious whether what I made is really healthier than the Campbell's canned tomato soup that I've used to date. I mean, it has to be healthier, it's 3 pounds of roasted Roma/plumb tomatoes, a yellow onion, a carrot, 1/2 cup heavy cream, couple cloves of garlic, dried basil, a little bit of salt/pepper, and a pinch of sugar.

1. Have pads and tampons in your bathroom - Even if you live alone, buy some tampons and sanitary pads, and keep them in your bathroom. It may happen, that there is a party at your place or someone simply comes over and gets unexpected period (sometimes they come a few days earlier, it just happens) - just let the girls know that you have their back in that case. You can tell them discreetly or just have a box marked ""pads and tampons :)"" in a visible place in your bathroom. 
2. Emergency pad or tampon in your car glove box is okay - doesn't take much place, can save someones day.
3. Every girl goes through period differently, so if you only experienced a girl that is acting normal, able to go jogging every morning and feeling all right on her period, don't say anything like ""you are overreacting"" or ""this can't be that bad"", or ""you are simulating"" when you see a girl who says she's very weak and feeling awful, suffering from bad cramps.
4. If you are close with the girl, ask her about her period preferences - some girls prefer to stay at home and nap a lot, some prefer staying active and going for walks. Some girls crave salty foods, some crave chocolates. Ask her if she uses any specific painkillers for her menstrual cramps and buy them to have at your place.
5. If you want to have any pills to help with menstrual cramps, look for something that is both a painkiller and relax muscles. You can ask a pharmacist, they will help you.
6. If you notice that a girl has a blood stain on her pants, tell her discreetly. Offer your jacket if you can, so she can tie it around her waist and at least cover the stain. 
7. If a girl on her period stays overnight, you can offer a towel (some old one) so she can put it under her butt - if there is any leaking, it won't stain your bed. 
8. If there is a blood stain, cover it with baking soda and spray vinegar on it. Let it sit for a few seconds, remove, repeat if needed. You can scrub a bit with an old toothbrush or other brush. When the stain is gone, you can rub some softener in that place so it doesn't smell of vinegar, but it's not obligatory as the smell will be gone after an hour or something.
9. Girl may cry for ""no reason"" - she saw an TV ad where dog got some no-name brand food and was sad because he wanted his favourite Advertised Brand Food - boom, she's sobbing. Don't say anything like ""this is not a reason to cry, stop acting like a baby"". She is probably aware that this is a stupid reason, she just can't fight her period-mind acting like that.

If you have hearing loss, your brain has to work harder to process the information it receives via noise. Delineating between background noise and speech can take a toll.

One remedy for this is to see if you can remove any earwax buildup first and foremost. Earwax buildup can contribute to hearing loss, and either seeing a doctor or home remedies can help. I cleaned my ears out last night and it made my day at work much easier to get through, more than I‚Äôve been able to in a while.

I‚Äôve also gone to the doctor before; I‚Äôd recommend loosening your earwax with special drops every night for a few nights leading up to your appointment so your doctor can get in there with a second set of eyes and hands and really flush it all out.

If you‚Äôve got clean ears, it‚Äôs recommended that if you work or socialize in a loud environment with a lot of background noise, to find a way to take some small 5 minute breaks in a quiet area throughout the day.","LPT: Chronic fatigue after a day of work or time spent socializing in public?

SublimeSupernova,t2_g0pu1356,1647213051.0,"Throughout my academic and professional career, I tried everything. Daily planner, calendar, to do lists, task manager, bullet journal, you name it. Nothing ever seemed to last once the enthusiasm of ""this helps!"" dies out. The truth is, you have to find ways to compel yourself to get things done. And for me, that was to start early and to start small.

How small are we talking? *Really small*. When I first started using this, I would break down whatever task I was avoiding into the tiniest possible action and start there. Need to read or study something? Commit to one page and then go back to whatever you were doing.

Need to write an email you've been putting off? Alright, hit the Compose button and type out the Subject. If that action alone carries you into completing the rest of the task, great! If not, it's in Drafts and you can move onto something else.

Need to do laundry? Get all your dirty clothes together and carry them to the washing machine. Need to fold them? Start by folding ONE thing. There's a momentum to completing tasks that you will get easier the longer you do this.

How early are we talking? Right now. Every time you think of *Start early, start small*, that's when you should be starting. Procrastination adds activation energy to a task. The longer you procrastinate, the harder it can feel to *finish* the task. Which is why we aren't focusing on *finishing* the task. We're focused on *starting* it. There's a minimal difference tangibly, but a huge difference psychologically.

What you will learn is that doing nothing is your baseline- so being able to do *anything* more than that is progress. Reading one page is better than none. Writing an email subject is better than nothing. Collecting and moving your dirty clothes is better than piling them up in your room. 

Eventually, accessing the discipline to start early and start small will come natural, and resisting the switch back to procrastinating will get easier. Then the utility of planners, calendars, and to-do lists reach their full potential.

**Note: Adding a task to a list is NOT starting the task.** This is a frustrating lesson to learn, since it can often be gratifying to put things in lists. Assembling your list of what needs done puts it into perspective and keeps your tasks in focus, but the list does not start the tasks themselves.","LPT: For me, there was no ""secret"" to getting past procrastination.

**What is coercive control?**

Coercive control is a pattern of behaviours intended to isolate, humiliate, exploit or dominate a person. This can include emotional, verbal and financial abuse ‚Äì like preventing someone from going to work or school, or limiting their access to finances. It could also include gaslighting, intimidation and belittling.

### What are the warning signs to watch for?

Coercive control can sometimes be referred to as ‚Äúinvisible chains‚Äù ‚Äì but the warning signs are actually quite visible, if you know what to look out for. These can include:

* Isolation from friends and family
* Monitoring of activity
* Monitoring whereabouts using devices such as GPS
* Threats, belittling or humiliation
* Jealousy
* Gaslighting
* Sexual coercion
* Controlling use of social media
* Threats to harm a pet or child
* Threats of suicide if the person leaves
* Restricted access to money or food
* Barrage of text messages

### How can I protect my phone or laptop from my significant other?

I am currently suffering from chronic upper back pain and my posture got worse in the last 2 years. I have to painfully stretch multiple times daily, take muscle-relaxants before going to sleep and painkillers twice a day to improve this situation.

The main cause for this was the height of my desk, which is at a whopping 77,5cm (30.5 inches or 2.55 feet). I don't want anybody else to have to go through this or realize this as late as I did.

There are many pictures and videos about correct posture on the internet, so check those out. But some basics are that you want to mainly aim at being able to keep your back straight, with your shoulders relaxed, forearms and thighs PARALLEL to the floor and soles firmly planted on the ground. If you aren't able to keep your posture this way, then respectively check your desk's and chair's height and find the part that is wrong. Desks with adjustable height work wonders if you can get one. 

Wish you all a great week and a healthy life!

Extra info: if your chair is too low or your desk is too high and you usually keep your arms on your desk (using mouse, using keyboard, writing etc.), it's going to cause an inflammation in your shoulder/upper back area, worsen your posture, close up your chest etc.

In my horror, I recommended they used a comb to get their dental health nightmare in order.

Toothpaste tubes recommend pushing from the back and flattening as you go up, which is incredibly difficult to do properly with hands, and rolling them up is incredibly menial. To solve this, you can put your tube of toothpaste on the counter, take the back end of any regular comb, and slide the loose toothpaste upwards towards the front.

What I do is start from either back corner of the tube at about a 45¬∞ angle, press hard into the counter and slide the comb towards the front of the tube, and then repeat on the other corner, then fold the tube once near the end of the empty part, and push in the middle to get maximum usage of my toothpaste.

I assume this is fairly well known, but for those of you hearing about this for the first time, enjoy!

We all know that one person who just really tries their best and isn't cruel or mean, but just can't get a grip when it comes to social nuances.

The best thing you can do to help them get by and even thrive in group situations is using a common tip in comedy/improv. Always ""yes and"" when they share something. If they say something really languid and meandering because they're not a naturally good storyteller, try to wring a point out of it yourself, try to work a moral into it, toss in a theoretical, just do anything. Actually actively engage with it instead of going for conversation enders like ""Wow, interesting"" or silent head nods that put the onus on them to figure out how to break the silence.

If someone stumbles through an awful joke they half thought up in their head in the moment and botched the delivery, layer on it with a relevant joke of your own. It doesn't even have to be a good joke, but the fact that you've effectively made the discussion into a ""skit"" means you're in it with them, you've got their back, and most people in the conversation will feel more at ease about the whole thing.

Caveat is that this requires you to be pretty good at social shit yourself. I'm definitely not the best in that regard, as I have pretty severe social anxiety myself. But I've gotten good enough at faking confidence that I now know how to help others who struggle with it despite their best efforts.

poizunman206,t2_1a1y1l4r,1647042511.0,"**Details:**

Recently, I've been baffled by the amount of people who just assume that they have no decision making power for their healthcare. Generally speaking, if you don't want to go to the hospital, want to be prescribed a different medication (e.g. an NSAID instead of an opioid), or even don't want a life saving procedure. Healthcare professionals will of course try to advocate for what decision they feel will be better, but at the end of the day, once the potential risks are explained to you and you still say no, that's your right (expressed consent).

**Caveats:**

If you don't have your faculties, have an altered mentation, or are unconscious, healthcare providers will go by what's called implied consent; that is essentially what can be assumed you'd want done if you were conscious and alert.  The other doctrine to be aware of is involuntary consent, but applies in very few cases. The only ones which come to mind are prisoners, people who have been arrested, or people who have attempted suicide. Minors are also in a weird spot since they can request care but can't refuse it (although to be totally honest, I'm not sure how much anyone would push that). A minor's guardian can also refuse care for them.

There's probably more details and legal stuff, but this should hopefully help you to understand the general guidelines of how these things work.

For example - I love the Dark Chocolate Thins with almonds and sea salt from Sam's Club, but a big bag is ~3,000 calories... so I just take a small handful at a time, enough to get the taste of it and to satisfy my sweet tooth. I can make a bag last a LOT longer that way and not fall into unhealthy eating habits.

If you're wanting to ween yourself from soda, set limits to drink less than you currently are, and then decrease as you go (say from 4 cans of Mountain Dew a day to 2 or 3, etc.).

The big takeaway I think: *Don't let someone tell you to straight up quit something just because it's inherently bad for you. Life's too short to always eat healthy greens and avoid sugar/carbs, but the key is to not eat them in excess.*

HeyItsMeUrDad_,t2_bwd5yps3,1647017521.0,"Hello all! I decided to compile some of the advice i have given over the years into a list of tips to save money on medications! 

Most of my formative career years were in safety net ER‚Äôs so we were constantly looking for ways to get creative to help patients save money. I have compiled a list of tips i can think of and will add to it/edit it as i think of them (or someone else adds a great tip!!)



1. ALWAYS buy generics. All you‚Äôre paying for with a brand name is the pretty label.  I will use brand names moving forward for ease of communication. 

2. OTC Ibuprofen/Motrin/Advil are all the exact same: 200 mg ibuprofen. You can take up to 800 mg TID, best to do with some food.  It is an NSAID and can irritate your stomach lining.  If you are unsure about the proper dosage for you, consult your doctor. 

3. Pamprin is a more expensive Excedrin. Don‚Äôt fall for it. (And as mentioned, buy generic Excedrin.)


4. Don‚Äôt buy Mucinex. It‚Äôs usually just a combination of a few cold medications and they Jack up the price 500%.

All otc meds are required by law to display their active ingredients and the dosage on the side of the bottles. Buy the generics of those ingredients. While 8 doses of Mucinex might run ya $20, you can buy acetaminophen, plain guafenesin, plain phenylephrine. Can usually find those for $1 apiece.

EDIT!!! I just did a quick google to check my maths. Got all three for $2.87. üòé

4. Always always ALWAYS check every single prescription you have on GoodRx. Just visit &lt;www.GoodRx.com&gt; and follow the prompts. Every single one. I have good insurance and i don‚Äôt even use it for about 80% of my prescriptions. I PERSONALLY have gotten Rx medication 90% off with it, and my current record savings with a patient was 95% off. 

Tell everyone you know about it. I‚Äôm surprised how few people know about it. In my opinion we should be stapling this info to every single discharge packet! 

5. Acetaminophen/Tylenol/Paracetamol are all the same, but DO come in many different dosages. Buy the cheapest one. 

6. For most adults, optimal OTC pain medication dosages is: Tylenol 1000 mg/Ibuprofen 800 mg, alternate every 3 hours. 

FOR KIDS: Tylenol 15/mg/kg, Ibuprofen 10 mg/kg. DONT short tour kids meds. The directions on the back for dosages are to cover their asses and can‚Äôt take into account the huge differences in kids weights. 

If you are unsure how to do the math, message me, I‚Äôll do it for you.  I hate to see kiddos hurting when it‚Äôs just a small, very fixable oversight.

I was an ER nurse for 10 years before i finally had a parent that properly medicated their kid for fever. Virtually everybody undersides their kids. I 100% understand why, they don‚Äôt want to hurt their babies!!! But proper fever control makes SUCH a huge difference in their pain and discomfort and makes them more likely to get some darn fluid in their systems!

4. Check manufacturers websites for coupons. Often they will have some pretty significant coupons for name brand medications. As i said before, get generic every time you can! But if you can‚Äôt, look for coupons!

What are YOU getting from your employer besides a pay check? If you have to work late or overtime on something because it‚Äôs a great idea or a significant achievement done right then think of it as value you are extracting for your future. Obviously you have to assess what‚Äôs worthwhile and what‚Äôs not. To give a specific example, let‚Äôs say you work overtime or extremely hard on a project or initiative and it‚Äôs successful because of your impact. You will be rewarded either by your current employer or another employer in the future for that skillset. Very few people can push through the implementation of something great that pays off and it‚Äôs highly marketable. For me personally looking back the hard work I‚Äôve put in here or there made me very marketable and increased my lifetime income. Did someone else or the company benefit? Yes. Did I benefit too?

There are several characters important: me (18F), my bf and his best friend (18M and 18M).

Act I- Scene I
When I walked in the class yesterday, the desks (who have been previously unpaired due to covid) are now paired. 3 rows, each with 5 sets of 2 desks. It was just me, Robin (fake name for my bf's bff) and some other boy in class at 7 am.
I decided to take a picture and send it on my class's group chat to ask them where they wanted to stay, as I have some difficult kids in my class that i didn't want to provoke.
By the time i sent it, i have already decided that i wanted the 3rd set of desks from the wall row, and Noah (fake name for my bf) and Robin the 4th, right behind me.
We said nothing, just giggled thinking about how they will fight for places in class.

Scene II
Helen - bossy, has previously interfered with my relationship, had a girl comment on how pretty her own bf was by T. (Another classmate) and now she's hardcore bullying her with her group of friends because T fucks a lot of guys. Helen's 5'8 and very robust, 190 lbs.

Joanne- kind of ex best friend, official but we distanced due to me not being the friend she wanted. She swore at me a lot, hated me cause me and Robin were good friends and she was in love with him. Robin hates Joanne (he thinks she's annoying and rude). Joanne is smart, but I'm talented where's she's just good and I'll be class valedictorian (highest notes in all hs years)

Helen enters the class saying she wants my place. I said no, i want it. She puts her bag next to me and sits on the chair next to mine, basically my deskmate. She calls Joanne saying something along the lines of ‚Äûi won't give up"" and we wait.
I'll have to fight for my place. I start to shake (stress related health problems) but I'm ready to kick Joanne's ass. She's also 5'8 but very fragile and has a leg problem. I think she's 110 lbs.
My bf also comes.
He sits behind me, and tries to comfort me.
Robin sits down, and says that whoever wants his place will have to fight him.
Joanne comes. She says she can use the nice method or the rude method. I say do whatever you want.
She says that it's been her desk since she 10th grade (before the covid thing). Noah says it's his since since he stayed there in 9th grade. Robin asks: DO YOU KNOW WHO STAYED HERE IN 1989?!?, mocking Joanne.
Joanne tells me to move, since my only reason to stay there is because I don't have anyone else to stay with.
Helen starts yelling that she already said on the group chat that she'll have that place (true, but i didn't check) and continues by saying to my bf: If you want to stay with her go get a desk and go fuck her in front of the class and leave us alone, it's our desk!
Joanne insists by saying: Leave! But now yelling. She calls me uneducated (because i didn't want to move when she wanted me to move), starts taking my stuff and moving it on another desk.
Another classmate,  D. suggests them another place, 3th set of desks on the window row. Joanne and Helen move, one last word by saying that I probably got those manners from Robin.

Scene III
Another classmate comes and kick Noah out of his desk. Invoking the ""I've been here first reason"", and him being unconfrontational, he left. I'm now wall row, first desk, and the boys are behind me.

Scene IV
The window row gossips about us. I've lived something similar in my middle school, but it's weird to live it again. Half of the class is on their side, and half doesn't care, but i can't be friends with them.
It's neverending. Four hours, completely distracting, and I hate them. My bf is dark with sadness, as they mocked our relationship.

Act II
At home, when I told my parents, they suggested going to their houses to teach them a lesson. I said no.
Because here's the thing.
I've been sleeping with my bf at his house for almost 2 years now, when I didn't want to come to school. They know it. Both Helen and Joanne. If my parents find out, I don't know what will happen.
Mom called Helen today and asked her if she's happy because I got sick from sadness. Helen asked her if she knew that I didn't come to school, but my mom told her that it's not her fucking business. She is fine, she doesn't suspect anything. She sent a text telling her to leave me alone. Helen then closed the called and is not answering anymore.
I got mom to agree to not say anything, but I know that if they say anything it will be the end for me. I can get to dad's or mom's phone to block them, and i am a little more scared.

I need a plan
A very good plan
I will go to school on Monday.
I can beat them red, I can threaten them but I think I need a good plan. I just want my parents to drop it. I don't care if they gossip me, but it will be better if they don't ever find out about me and Noah.

First, Never put the storage and suitcases in the room before you check the bed. Leave it outside then inspect the bed and furniture. If there‚Äôs bedbugs you should immediately leave and request a refund. If that‚Äôs done, you can bring your luggage in. But DO NOT open the luggage until you do a UV light inspection, shine the UV light on the surfaces as UV can and will pick up bedbugs. It will also pick up gross stains. If you have watched another dirty room, you have seen what a UV light can do. And never. Set your luggage on a hard surface or carpet if possible, if the hotel has a hard tile area please use that to unload.

Do not use dressers if possible. If possible it is recommended to use your suitcase as the dresser and storage.

If you don‚Äôt find any signs of bedbugs. You should still be extremely cautious. Make sure to bring your own clean linens as the hotel linens may have not been washed. Also make sure to change things like the pillowcases. Put all your sleepwear in a plastic bag away from the other clothing. Designate sleepwear or sleep butt naked, change your sleepwear every night. Check every piece of furniture in the room. Including the carpet and corners. Unwashable clothing should also be put in a ultra secure bag.

And after your stay, you should always immediately wash every single piece of clothing that has entered the hotel in a washer. Make sure to DRY FIRST, Then wash and dry.

Also, it does not matter if the hotel is a days inn on skid row or a ritz Carlton in Beverly Hills. Always check. Bedbugs are a epidemic now and you need to avoid them as much as possible.

And when the PS6 comes out, I'll buy a used PS5 and a crapload of games for the same or similar. Even games at places like EB Games (Australia's Gamestop) are often very cheap - I bought Fallout 4 for PS4 for $9.

Another advantage is that you won't waste money on overhyped games like Cyperpunk 2077 or Duke Nukem Forever that turn out to be duds. By the time games have aged a few years, you will know what the best ones are. Then you can grab Red Dead Redemption 2 for $10 instead of some stinking turd for $80.

I recently secured a job in Abbotsford, BC and I am starting in a month. I have got a couple of weeks to plan and move things.

I have a TV, monitor, mattress, a guitar, couple of check-in size luggage and 2 boxes.

Also, I am looking for a place to stay in Abbotsford so, any advice/tips related to Abbotsford is also welcomed.

The second alarm should be outside your bedroom near a comfortable chair. I set this alarm on my phone. When I groggily get out of bed to turn it off, I just sit down in the chair and browse my phone for about 15 minutes.

It did have wood trim where the walls met the floors, wooden window sills, and a large wooden staircase to go between floors.  The window sills started to have these little lines of brown powder that looked a bit like sawdust or sand. We didn't really think about it...until one day we found that our wardrobe, which was touching the wood trim had had the back eaten out of it and the termites were eating our low-use clothing in the bottom drawer. Like piles of termites. A whole colony.  Further exploration of the house revealed that they had also dined on some cardboard boxes we had stored under the stairs.

It was shocking. It was also a great learning experience because it wasn't our building.  We saw the signs, these little lines of unidentified droppings over a month before we found out about all the other stuff.

The moral of the story is that it would've been very useful to have identified the little termite lines as soon as we saw them.  We never once saw an insect until we had a serious infestation.

There are about a million websites that will show you pics of what the signs of termites look like.  I'm not going to post any because they are all commercial exterminators and I don't want to be seen as trying to advertise one.  there are also videos (also by commercial exterminators).

30 minutes of your time might save you a major problem that could cost a serious amount of money to both fix and then address the damage.  Having a brick or concrete home does NOT mean you don't have to worry.

Many of the entry certs are free or low cost to take for example Lean Six Sigma has a white belt cert that is free and shows prospective employers that your at least aware of the field. Other certs exists as well that are free or under $200 things like IT certs etc. Again as an example the yellow belt for Six Sigma is 100 USD and is open book with the book being a free download on their website.  Many of these certs even have free online study guides that you can use or can find. Also if your working for an employer already look and see if you can sign up for any certs and if they will cover them many STEM fields do.   


some easy examples 

* Basic Special inspector From ICC is 61 USD its the foundation for other special inspector courses important in California
* Six Sigma white and yellow belt book is free, white belt is free and yellow belt is 100 USD per attempt.
* Google certs 39 USD a month for their certs idk how well recognized they are though and its a course not just exam

* CWI: Certified Weld Inspector is a doozy its hard, but these guys are always in demand a  is the goat of all certs. There are other certs in this field, but this one opens a lot of doors.

If the headlight is 44 inches high for example, then mark a spot on the wall at 39 inches, and adjust the top of the beam to that height. Cars are slightly different (that angle on a car would leave your light dangerously short), but always adjust the top of the beam below the bulb. Both beams should be level across the top as well. 

Most headlights have an adjustment point on top of the assembly. You can easily Google your vehicle, I'd almost guarantee there's a YouTube video that shows you exactly how. In a lot of vehicles, there's a hole on top that you put a Phillips screwdriver into. Just turn it until you see the beam moving, then adjust to where you need it. You may have to tap the assembly as you do it, depending on the age, condition, and wear on your vehicle. 

This is more important if you run LEDs, and especially if you run LEDs in a standard halogen housing. Even just replacing halogen bulbs with the same brand can leave the aim point out of alignment. Your headlights are designed to show you as much of the road as possible without being a hazard to other drivers. If your low beams are pointed where your high beams should be, then your high beams will shoot over the top of cars around you and be useless. 

A little extra: DO NOT RUN LIGHT BARS ON THE ROAD. They're far too bright for the cars around you. It's illegal in some states, but it's a bad idea in all of them. Even the small cube lights are a bad idea. Light bars are typically a flood beam, which means the light isn't aimed. They might not seem that bad to you standing in your driveway, but when you add the reflective surface of even a dry road, they're dangerous to any cars traveling around you. Add water, ice, or snow to that surface, and you are just making it unsafe for others. If you can't see well enough using just your headlights (and fog lights if required), you shouldn't be driving.",LPT Aim your headlights.,LifeProTips,False,1.0,1.0,1.0

gomi-panda,t2_1o6i6jc4,1646771326.0,"In neuroscience it's been clearly established that we are not simply of ""one mind"" when we make a decision, but we have competing ""congresses"" of mind that parry against each other until a decision is made.

When deciding over something as trivial as choosing between two different flavors of ice cream, there are neurons in your brain that will literally build up for, say, strawberry ice cream. And there will also be competing neurons that will build up for, say chocolate ice cream. The ""column"" with the most neurons built up in it will be the one that wins the decision. This is well documented in the field of neuroscience.

When you don't have a strong opinion between one flavor vs another, you experience a feeling like you are wrestling against yourself to make up your mind. But once you select your flavor and are rewarded by the delicious creamy taste (obviously strawberry is the superior flavor), the next time you have to decide, it becomes that much easier to choose the same flavor.

Over time, this is how knee-jerk reactions and habits begin to take hold.

And now back to the LPT. If you have lived your life internally obsessing over future or past conversations, this can lead to mental illness. What matters is staying in the present and taking life as it comes, not dwelling outside of the present. In this case, your neurons are primed to obsess. And so the only way to change this is to behave differently. ""Column A"" may be loaded with neurons that prime you for obsession, while ""column B"" may barely put up a fight. 

But here's the good news. The more you begin to challenge ""column A"" by telling yourself ""no"" and persevering with some grit to stop the behavior, the more your obsession will lose its grip. ""Column B"" in other words, can eventually win out, just like the superiority of strawberry ice cream over chocolate.

Put up a fight and win over yourself. Don't obsess over your doubts or even waste your time expressing them unless you are asking for help.","LPT: If you often find yourself in your head anticipating what to say in an argument or constantly reliving past scenarios and what you could have done better, know that the very act of consciously forcing your mind to refocus plays a huge role in stopping obsessive thoughts altogether",LifeProTips,False,1.0,1.0,1.0

What fun it was to find Jolly Rogers Telephone on the web. The demo video I saw created a compelling impression that JRT wastes enough of a telelphone marketers time that it may no longer be worthwhile for them to harass you. But the industry for phone scamming offshore is orders of magnitude bugger, and the time of the guys on the front lines is worth way, way less. They also leverage force multiplication by using robocallers. Does JRT still make a big enough dent in their time to make a difference?

Also, how can interested and potential users of JRT be sure that access to one's home phone will be safeguarded? Maybe I read too much about conspiracies, but I picture (say) Apple, Google, Microsoft, or Netflix making backroom deals to provide information to the NSA, some Organization With No Name, or an international cabal that operates completely informally. Sort of like the mafia on steroids. Or what if they keep 99.99% of the scammers away, and give exclusive access to scammers who are willing to pay a premium? (Never mind that such high end scammers wouldn't need to scam strangers through their home phones, or why they would be interested in little-ol' you or me).

I don‚Äôt know if it got me accepted into more schools but it didn‚Äôt hurt. 1/3rd of people who previously identified as white have a cultural awakening and change identities.

On top of that just found this study ‚ÄúAccording to a study done by Princeton University, Asian Americans applicants‚Äô SAT scores had to be 140 points higher than White students, 270 points higher than Hispanic students, and 450 points higher than Black students in order to be admitted to top universities. ‚Äú 
So maybe it helped my actual acceptance more than I thought. Either way I rode my 1% black 23andme into my college of choice and graduated with 0 debt thanks to the financial packages.

ExplorAI,t2_13ocpr,1646731058.0,"A theme can be a thing, a purpose, or an activity. The theme should be something you always love.

Examples:

A thing you've always loved: space, animals, cars. 
A purpose you always feel excited about: teaching, helping the poor, fighting for a specific cause.
An activity you have always enjoyed: making art, gaming, travel

Now try to tie any new hobby back to your one theme. Never deviate from this. For example:

You want to try out baking. 
If your theme is animals, bake animal shaped cookies or research what treats various animals are allowed to eat and how to make them.
If your theme is helping the poor, have a bake sale and donate the money to the poor or start a baking class where you donate part of the proceeds or volunteer to help fill Christmas packages for the poor.
If your theme is travel, learn baking recipes from different cultures and try them out.

Now let's try a different type of hobby. You always wondered how good you'd be in math so you are going to study a little on your own.
If you theme is animals, there is a lot of basic math that goes into the logistics of animal care at scale. You could look into volunteering (or working!) At the origanizational level of an animal charity.
If your theme was helping the poor, you could teach math to kids in disadvantaged neighbourhoods! Or indeed look at helping out in the logistics of charity.
If your theme is travel, you can try calculating all kinds of fun or interesting travel related facts like how to make the best budgets, but also the geometry of how to tell the time from the angle of the sun etc or for more complicated things, maybe the math behind various popular architecture.

But wait, how do you make money off this???

First off, this approach builds your skills and network. Both will help you find that dream job. But in the mean time, slow and steady wins the race. Look at economically viable skills you like that combine well with your theme. For example:

Animal theme: Work at an animal shelter, study to become a vet, or start an animal charity.
Helping the poor: you can look at anything from politics and charity for direct help, to designing tools and systems that might help them, to teaching etc.
Traveling theme: writing a travel blog with more unique content (from your hobbies), working for a travel agency, or teaching English as a foreign language in different countries.

Over a period of 10 years or so of the above, you'll slowly drift to more and more interesting challenges within your theme as your expertise develops. And best part about it is, you can pursue any hobby, skill, or project you want in the mean time. You'll be a jack of all trades AND master of one!

We talked on the phone several times, we met, and I tried this for two weeks. I was essentially carrying this. Had our last call few 4-5 days ago and it felt like a micro-version of the same break up.

I was feeling fine earlier but now its **REALLY** starting to hit me hard!

Maybe for the better as I am question why am I putting myself through this where she's moved on and enjoying her time with her friends and enjoying life? Told me she moved one with a sense of pride that she moved on after a 5 1/2 year relationship within a matter of 2 weeks of no communication?

I feel so DESPONDENT that I can't think to leave my room for the time being. I just feel so suffocated. I feel like nothing matters right now. I can't focus at work, and it's piling up strong. 

I felt so much anger and resent towards myself throughout the day all I could do to calm myself is to do pushup every 10-15 minutes.

Our relationship wasn't, there were room for improvement, I take classes and dabble in philosophy for fun and way of living but the last time we spoke, I was told all the ways her friends relationships were better. That hurt in a different kind of way.

I also received many exciting opportunities, it was incredible the sudden projects that the universe provided to me and they would land in my lap without me doing much. For example, through a chance meeting I was offered to write a short film that then got picked up by a leading streaming platform. Out of sheer luck I would end up in parties or gatherings having fascinating conversations with people only to find out that they were in fact the owner of one of the biggest ad firms in the country (I was traveling in India at the time) and they themselves continued to stay in touch from a professional standpoint. I remember they said something of the likes of ‚Äúyou have a unique perspective and it‚Äôs valuable, you think differently and we need more people like you looking to solve problems in an innovative way.

Hybrid-PC,t2_15p9hw,1646687473.0,"Let me preface this by saying it does require some nuance depending on the situation, and is not a blanket rule.

However, it can apply to many situations.

You can choose the short term sacrifice of making exercise a habit now, and generally avoid completely sacrificing your health in your later years. You also feel great while doing it. In general this applies to many aspects when it comes to taking care of your health.

If you just graduated high school, and you plan on going to college, you can likely take a gap year where you work as much as possible to avoid going into massive amounts of debt assuming you can still live with your parents (little bit of nuance there). After this gap year, find a balance between quality and cost when picking a school, and choose a degree with high growth and decent to high pay. The sacrifices here are, waiting a year (or more!) to continue education, being super frugal with spending during that year (and throughout your degree), working as much as you can, maybe being a year behind your peers from high school if you care about that, and maybe not choosing your absolute first choice when it comes to a degree. This isn't to say don't choose something you aren't comfortable doing, or would not enjoy. 

During your degree, maybe you sacrifice some of your social life in order to ensure that you come out on the right side of your biggest investment yet, your future. Maybe during large breaks, you work on some projects to show potential employers you're dedicated. Maybe you sacrifice a summer during your junior or senior year for an internship, or other form of work, and get your foot in the door, making your job search post grad that much easier.  There are then several sacrifices you get to avoid in the future (assuming all went well). For one, avoidance of the worst kind of debt you can get yourself into, student loans. If the job you get post grad pays well and has great benefits (401k, dental, medical, vision, etc.) you can avoid part of the sacrifice that comes with saving for retirement, going into as much medical debt, you name it. Your job may not be your absolute favorite, but you just made yourself so much more time and money to explore hobbies or do things you do enjoy. 

What I mean by this college/high school example is it's generally a good idea to make yourself a skilled, highly valuable worker. This means that you may be taking away time and energy from other things you may enjoy, especially while you're young. There are other routes in this as well, such as trades, or getting certificates online even.  

I'm sure many of you will disagree, and the example I picked may not be applicable to everyone, but think through your experiences, regrets, etc. and try to see where a small sacrifice could've saved a much bigger, often involuntary one. With these sacrifices comes a burden of responsibility, and I believe that taking on this responsibility makes you a better person overall.","LPT: Life is a game of sacrifices, and more often than not you get to choose!",LifeProTips,False,1.0,1.0,1.0

Infamous_Ad1129,t2_g7p1405b,1646679302.0,"Hi everyone,

I have a difficult career decision to make and need some advice. I have two full-time job offers as a physical therapist: both of them are in equivalent in salary and my overall impression of the job itself.

I am 30 years old. My parents are in their 60s, healthy and retired. My parents mean a lot to me and they love seeing me when I visit, we love doing activities together. They live in Canada and it is very cold in the winters from December to March. I have mild Raynaud's disease, where I am very sensitive to the cold, my hands and feet hurt a little bit and I can‚Äôt go outside for long periods (over 30 min) without having some discomfort. I really hate the cold! I love the summer months in Canada (May to September) and I have so much more energy and vitality.

Here are the two job offers:

offer A) Working close to family, about 2 hour driving distance away. I could see my parents almost every second week, and that would make both me and them very happy. However the cold winters would be difficult as usual and I know I am significantly less happy in the winters.

offer B) Working far from family, about 15 hour drive away. The job is in the southern United States, with very mild winters. My parents would be undoubtedly sad, and I would feel a bit guilty being so far away. I could only see them maybe three times per year and I would miss seeing them often. However, avoiding the cold from December to March would be much better for my overall health and well-being.

I don't think there is a right or wrong answer. I would any appreciate any advice or insight on what you think would be the better decision for me, for my overall health and happiness.

# How To Break Your Old Patterns

#### As children,we were easily exposed to the outer world with all its generational beliefs,societal behaviors and mistaken truths,which were passed to us unconsciously .as a result,we grow up adopting false thinking patterns that weren't ours on the first place,until we reach certain awareness that allows us to seek inner truth and break these cycles .

So here are few ways to help you break old thoughts and behavioral patterns:  


### 1-Get closer to yourself

the only way to get to know yourself better and create a strong bond is spending time alone by yourself,this will allow you clear your mind from the world's distractions and reach a mutual deep understanding that leads to the discovery of your own truth.  


### 2-Curiosity/honesty

be ready to start questioning your own ideas,thoughts and behaviors especially the ones that feel triggering or uncomfortable .and be honest with whatever answers you get even if it feels chaotic and disturbing,that's just your mind's confused with the process.the more you're able to seek inner truth, the faster you're finding your own identity.  


### 3-Objective thinking

remove and unlink your own memories and emotions from the thoughts or situations you are questioning,by doing this,you are separating your own perspective and position about the situation ,from its true image.this process will provide you with better understanding quality to generate logical answers rather than biased ones.  


### 4-Stop seeking pleasure

stop seeking pleasure when looking for deep answers inside you. only the right questions will make you stressed and anxious,however, avoiding doubting and asking about certain things to keep the peace will only provide you with short-term pleasure ,which will keep you running in the same old patterns .  


### 5-Acknowledge your past

when our inner self is deeply wounded due to past-trauma,it impacts our way of thinking and behaving. as we grow up lacking awareness of these trauma responses which were ""coping mechanisms"" adopted to protect our minds from past-trauma damage.until we choose to break the repeated cycle by acknowledging the behaviors which are ""linked"" to certain traumatic events or situations.  


### 6-Deal not escape

these patters aren't part of who you are,these are just a set of beliefs you picked up along the way growing up.the comfortability and familiarity with these patterns will trick you into believing they are part of your true personality and character.  


### Conclusion

breaking your old thinking and behavioral patterns is a process that requires patience,consistency and lot of efforts especially for people who suffered from past-traumatic experiences.however,it is one of the greatest steps you can take towards unleashing your true potential and discovering who you are.

RockleyBob,t2_nsd6l,1646662109.0,"#####**Tl;Dr:** Don't set your luggage on beds or upholstered couches. Don't use hotel dressers or shelves unless you have to, and opt for hangers if you can't live directly out of your luggage. Designate sleeping clothes and be super cautious even if you don't notice signs of infestation. Bag your sleepwear in plastic and isolate it from your other clothes when you pack. Wash everything in warm water and dry on high for at least an hour when you get home. 

Bed bugs are [making a huge comeback](https://www.vox.com/2015/4/27/8502491/bed-bugs-kill-increase) due in part to pesticide resistance, and hotels are a prime place for transmission of these parasites. 

Your first line of defense is always to inspect the room thoroughly. Check the mattress under the sheets and mattress cover for spots or [discoloration](https://bedbuglawyer.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/bed-bug-infestation-on-a-mattress-e1629294258192.jpg). Depending on their [lifecycle stage](https://cdn.domyown.com/images/content/bed_bug_life_cycle_stages.png), bed bugs and their eggs can range [from the size of a tiny speck to a sesame seed](https://bedbuglawyer.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-31-at-1.32.57-PM.jpg). 

You want to check pillows, the bed frame, and any cushions or upholstery in the room as well. 

The good news is that, unlike ticks or lice, bed bugs don't like heat and don't typically live on their hosts (aka **us**). Instead, they find harborages in nearby cracks, cloth, and crevices, and wait until we're asleep to feed. They travel by hitching rides amongst your clothing and luggage. That means that if you can keep your belongings away from where they live and feed, and don't cross contaminate your bed wear with everything else, you can mitigate (not eliminate) your risk of bringing these pests home with you.

Don't take chances with these things, a bed bug infestation is notoriously hard to eliminate. These simple precautions might save you thousands in exterminator fees and possibly a case of PTSD.","LPT: Don't take chances with bed bugs!

Somebody can tell you that a person they do not like is cruel, manipulative, selfish.(A) It is harder to remember that is how they are characterizing someone over the course of a memory. Listen to their stories, especially ones that don't focus on that person, and how that person is portrayed in them.

That cruel, manipulative, selfish person might show up in a story where they save the day, but since that is not the storytellers intent they forget that's what the story is showing. They tell a story about a wild party that gets out of hand and A shows up and becomes a designated driver without anyone asking that gets them all out of there before the police show up. Since the point of the story was the party they forget how they are intending to characterize A otherwise

Those stories where they forget their bias because it's not part of the events is how you really can see who someone is over what someone just tells you.

k07ya,t2_k7yo6ozs,1646611023.0,"I am going through a break-up right now.

I   initiated the break about month and a half ago. During the first week  my now ex gf had tried reaching out to me (not saying she wanted to get  back together but angry and maybe hinting at that, which would lead to  more arguments).

We had gotten  into a bad argument and this is the result. We hadn't spoken for nearly  three weeks and once I felt I was in a good space, I reached out. By  then she had moved on (not seeing anyone but emotionally; what  difference would that make anyways, sooner or later we both will).  Anyways we had met once since and spent the night.

We  spoke a few days later and I asked her for us to see each other without  getting back together right away she said she was too hurt the last  time around, so I left it at that. Best to let her be at peace.

It was hard and has been hard but I am starting to feel I need to start moving on and improve myself.

**NOW**:  this brings me to my question in the title. I thought about spending  some money on getting dating advice but decided against it. This $2,000 I  had set aside for her and I to travel this spring. But, that's not  happening, so I want to use this money to better myself and I need  IDEAS!

How would you spend this money?

What would you do to improve yourself that you normally wouldn't think to do?

I  have a few good friends (that I don't see very often) and my social  circle has taken a hit during the course of my relationship (while she  put in the effort into hers). So seeing friends and things would be  somewhat of a limited idea at the moment.

BTW, my friends and family been like a rock! Supporting me daily and checking in on me! Just wanted to throw that in there.

Please  feel free to share any experience or give advice for bettering yourself  or just getting over a relationship. Even though this isn't my first  breakup, it still hurts. The pain comes and goes in bouts these days,  I've come to accept that and move forward with my life.","LPT how can I spend $2,000 to better myself?",LifeProTips,False,1.0,1.0,1.0

pickyourpants,t2_5xvijxp9,1646598477.0,"I doubt I'm the first person in this sub to say this but **please consider taking a first aid course**.

It's a long time since I took one and, yesterday, I failed to save a life. Now, there is absolutely no guarantee that I could have saved this person's life but if I was appropriately trained, it can only have increased the odds.

Before I get into the story, please note that I am not looking for sympathy or an assessment of what I did or did not do. I simply want to encourage people to get trained. I don't feel responsible for the death of this person but I really wish I could have done more. If you happen to have a story of a time you did or did not save a life that you want to add, please do. The more stories we have, maybe the more people will get trained.

Yesterday, we were driving in the Oakland hills, taking our kids to a school event. As we were rounding a bend, we were flagged down by two gentlemen, standing next to a motorcycle that had obviously come off the road, who asked us to call 911. We pulled over and I called 911 as I jogged over to the scene. First note - there were mile markers along the side of the road that I didn't notice but a passing cyclist did (thank you anonymous cyclist) and they were crucial in helping emergency services find us.

When I got to the scene, I saw the motorcyclist lying on the ground, on his back, immobile. It's such a long time since I took any first aid training that the first things that came to my mind were the warnings about ways in which a careless and untrained person (i.e. me in this story) could further hurt a patient. This means I spent the first minute or two (maybe more?) not really approaching the patient and giving the emergency services person on the phone only minimal information (also, thank you emergency phone line people, you are amazing). I could see that he had wire around his neck but I had no way of cutting it. I was worried about removing his helmet in case I damaged his spine and I was worried about unzipping his armored jacket for basically the same reason. This meant that I could not really tell if he was breathing, I could only check his pulse (there was one).

Thankfully, at this point, another motorcyclist, in yellow, showed up and he was much more confident about unbuckling and removing the helmet and unzipping the jacket. He also cut the wire that was wrapped around the patients neck. Finally, we could see that the patient was not breathing (and his pulse and stopped by now) and I started chest compressions, with the woman from 911 giving me instructions. I switched out with another helpful motorcyclist who had stopped (this one in red) after about 5 minutes and he did another 5 before police showed up. I have no idea how long the patient had been laying there before I arrived so I have no idea how much of an impact those first few minutes of inactivity had on his chances of survival... but I figure every second helps. If I had been better trained, I might also have been able to give the woman at 911 better information about the state of the patient, faster, and... I don't know but it certainly couldn't had made anything worse.

So, if you take a first aid course, there is no guarantee that you will ever save someone but it definitely makes it more likely. This motorcyclist who crashed is now gone and most probably left a hole in the life of many people. It would be nice if we could help that happen less often, even if only a little.",LPT: Take a First Aid Course,LifeProTips,False,1.0,1.0,1.0

dirtyALEK,t2_85jff03r,1646596687.0,"Teaching your child to cook has many benefits. 

(1) your child will likely have a much better diet if they know how to cook for themselves. Those that don‚Äôt are much more likely to turn to overpriced and nutritionally empty junk foods.

(2) sending your child to get the groceries you‚Äôll use to make dinner together will prepare them for doing it on their own and make them more familiar with prices. This can also be a good segue into teaching them how to budget. 

(3) being able to cook for others can be a great social skill for becoming friends with roommates or impressing a date. Everyone loves the guy/gal responsible for a great dinner. 

(4) teaching them how to cook before they leave can be a great opportunity to make some memories with them before they go.

(5) cooking is fun and easy! Even if YOU don‚Äôt know how to cook yourself, there are endless YouTube videos that you and your child can use to learn together. Most of it boils down to heating things up and seasoning them until they taste good, and even if you make a mistake there‚Äôs almost always a way to recover. The rest is just timing and learning little tips and tricks over time. 

Lastly: don‚Äôt assume that your child knows how to cook if they don‚Äôt already do so regularly. Things that may seem obvious to you (pat drying chicken before you pan sear it, washing vegetables and fruits, even how to use a rice cooker) your child is likely totally unaware of. It‚Äôs also MUCH easier and more fun to teach your child while they‚Äôre still with you than over FaceTime.

1) this is an advanced technique for experienced couples only

2) never mistake me for a fool.

Ok so this is the move:

First thing to do is in advance, tell your partner to press thier lips loosely together if you ever happen put your mouth around her nose.

So then sometime when you are kissing like normal move your mouth and position it completely over her nose, forming a ""seal"" around the perimeter of the nose with your lips. Then you exhale gently into the nose. Per your prior conversation, the partner will loosely press together his or her lips. As you blow, air will be forced out through the partner's lips generating a raspy tooting sound.

And that's the Flabbergaster! Great for strengthening already strong relationships by bringing some spice into the kissing realm.

Some notes: 

You man exhale gently *or* with gusto depending on you and your partner's preferences. More experienced couples may experiment with inhaling at varying speeds as well. Just Google ""flabbergasting advanced techniques"" for even more.

This move may be performed during sex. Couple report (on average) to have orgasms that last up to three precent longer if they are Flabbergasting, and up to six percent longer if they are being Flabbergasted on during the moment of orgasm.

ShuffledPast,t2_mzreo,1646594585.0," Disclaimer: Quick statement before anyone starts to point it out, I am not so concerned about my writing quality in this post or any potential grammatical errors.

So, I am really lost in life and struggling with what decision I should make when it comes to what I should do to quickly (relatively speaking) switch over to another job (and start an actual career) and in a deeper sense, trying to find what I want/should do in life to finally be content and feel happy with myself. I feel like I already know the answer to what I should do, but there are still a few things that I know I could really use some advice/opinions on, part of why I am not taking action is purely hesitation due to an inherent lack of motivation/ambition. Before I get to the main point, I‚Äôd like to give some of my background before I give the two options I am thinking of taking in order to get a job, this is to somewhat ‚Äúpaint a picture‚Äù of who I am.

So, I graduated from a university receiving a B.A. forever ago (2014) in a degree that was maybe not ‚Äúuseless‚Äù per se, but simply put, not a practical degree that is heavily sought after unless you do a LOT to make yourself stand out from all the competition. Yes, I realize you can make that argument for many things, but realistically speaking there are fields that are heavily sought after (nursing for example) that it doesn‚Äôt matter what place you finished in your program, just that you passed, have the license, and you will find somewhere to work. The professor of another program (will get into that shortly) even said the same thing to me and other students about us just passing. Well my B.A. degree doesn‚Äôt fit in that category. After I graduated I tried looking for a job related to my career field with still never really having a clear goal of what I even wanted to do in terms of a profession in that field, only that I had an interest in what I had studied but I just wanted a job. If I am honest, I didn‚Äôt look terribly hard or probably didn‚Äôt look as hard as I should‚Äôve and didn‚Äôt put as much energy and effort in the job searching process due to a lack of motivation/ambition and I wanted to take a break after graduating. Eventually I got a job working at a warehouse where my mom worked, I worked there for about 2-3 years (I can‚Äôt remember exactly) and only part-time because that is the only thing they offered, and while I was complacent and somewhat content, the entire time every single day I was thinking of my situation, depressed, and thinking that I can‚Äôt continue this forever. I was depressed for various reasons: I knew this wasn‚Äôt really something I could make a career out of, because my parents put a higher standard on me and my sibling that I was (and still am) falling short on, and because I know realistically I would never have been able to financially support myself with that job working part-time. Eventually at the end of that timespan, I reached a fork in the road and decided I need to make a life-changing decision there and then, continue working there or go back to school because unfortunately as much as I utterly despised the idea of going back to school, it was my only alternative option and I simply wasn‚Äôt going to get a better job due to lack of work experience (like many college students) and so my life wasn‚Äôt going to change if I didn‚Äôt attempt it.

I ended up deciding to apply for a very difficult and rigorous school program in the healthcare field that I wasn‚Äôt really interested in, I did it because it was a career that had a high job growth, I needed to stop ‚Äúmessing around‚Äù, and I told myself ‚Äúsometimes in life you got to things you don‚Äôt want to do‚Äù. In short, it was a decision I made out of practicality, not because I had any real interest or skill in that field. I still didn‚Äôt have much passion or ambition towards any particular career period, but I needed to pursue something that would finally give me an actual career afterwards. As I already said, the program was extremely difficult especially since it was in something I never had any interest in, but I had reached a ‚Äúfork in the road in my life‚Äù and I was absolutely determined like never before and was going to give it my all. I was studying roughly 10 hours a day, even on the weekends, I was unbelievably stressed out of my mind and due to all that stress and anxiety, I was perhaps the most miserable and depressed I‚Äôve ever been. My parents and my sibling (of whom I was living with) were impressed and surprised at how hard I was studying and how I just completely devoted my life to the program (not that I had any other choice with how hard the program was). I say this not because I am saying that I was a slacker in school (was always an ‚ÄúA‚Äù ‚ÄúB‚Äù student with the occasional ‚ÄúCs‚Äù but mostly got ‚ÄúB‚Äù I‚Äôd say on average), but I was never one of those typical overachievers who were either naturally smart or studied a lot to make sure they got straight ‚ÄúAs‚Äù. Eventually though I reached my breaking point in the 3rd semester, I wouldn‚Äôt go as far as saying I had a panic attack because I didn‚Äôt, but I failed a lab exam and I broke down crying hard in the shower and breathing heavily, I was depressed, exhausted and pissed that I failed that exam. Afterwards I got to a point where I literally couldn‚Äôt push myself to study anymore, every time I tried, an overwhelming sense of exhaustion came over me. I always say, even if I were to have taken more free time (which I still inherently felt I couldn‚Äôt do, I was studying that hard because I needed to in order to pass my classes ‚Äòbarely mind you‚Äô) I don‚Äôt think it would‚Äôve made a difference, I simply was burnt out, was depressed due to all the studying and not knowing why and what I was doing there in that program since it wasn‚Äôt something I had any interest in. 

After this time period I was really REALLY down, I felt ashamed of myself because not only did I ‚Äúquit‚Äù the program but I had managed to somehow push myself and study harder than I ever had in my life (albeit at the expense of my mental and physical health) and that in of itself I saw as sort of an accomplishment. Although in the end it was something that did not bring me any fruition and I can‚Äôt replicate that level of discipline now even if I wanted to (which I don‚Äôt due to the high stress and anxiety that comes with it). I once again had to move back in with my parents and started to look for whatever work I could possibly find, at first I only managed to find part-time work at a fine dining restaurant, eventually the COVID 19 pandemic hit and me and many co-workers of mine were laid off. I then found work as a remote customer service rep (think call center) for a large national car insurance company, I also didn‚Äôt have interest in this particular field, but I needed work. This was actually my first full-time job but we (hirees) all had to go through a 1-2 month of remote training via webcam and once again a high level of stress started to creep back up because of the fast rate we were going through material, because I wasn‚Äôt good at learning about insurance policy, and I (like many) don‚Äôt do well learning remotely like that. It wasn‚Äôt the same level of stress that I experienced in the program (I personally don‚Äôt think anything will match that level of stress) but it was enough to remind me of the program and I am simply not going to put myself through that ever again. I ended up leaving that, and I found a job at a warehouse distribution center working full-time, and have been there ever since (reached my one year anniversary in January).  

So here are the two options that I am thinking about: It is between either applying for a job in the area of copywriting/content writing or public relations specialist OR to find a place such as a marketing agency where I can see if they will allow me to volunteer to actually pick up skills. As I mentioned earlier, I think I already know which path I am leaning more towards, the volunteering path. The reason being is because I have already experienced the joys \[insert sarcasm\] of applying for jobs wherein I (like many MANY others, it‚Äôs not unique to me) would send in application after application after application and would be absolutely lucky if I even got a reply or even a phone interview (that‚Äôs like a godsend right there) and frankly after a while I became exhausted, disheartened, and downright depressed. I also feel like no matter how well I try to ‚Äúmarket‚Äù myself when applying, no one is really going to offer me the chance because although I have done some writing in a past internship for example and have written may research papers in college, I don‚Äôt have any experience when it comes to this field in particular. If I remember correctly too, I know for a fact that I had applied to one (maybe two; not sure) copywriter positions for example years back (before the COVID pandemic started) and while I was lucky to speak with someone over the phone after persistent calling to reach someone about my application, she was friendly, thought my past internship experience was interesting, but in the end the response was something akin to ‚Äúunfortunately, we are looking for someone who has experience doing this‚Äù. So I feel like I would be wasting a lot of time and energy, and I really want to waste as little time as possible to changing my life around when it comes to a career. I know there is no guarantee that the volunteer option will lead to a job through whatever agency I find or otherwise, but even if I don‚Äôt get a job offer from them, I will have at least picked up skills from a legitimate place that I can put on my resume and also show that I was still staying active and trying to pick up skills all the while working full-time. I am not trying to do both options at the same time (volunteering and applying), it‚Äôs one or the other, I am also not trying to return to school. One other point I‚Äôd like an opinion on, I‚Äôd like to know what you guys think on how long I should make my dedicated time at the place I found to volunteer at. As quickly as I want to change things around, I feel as though I should be there for at least a year, especially since I would only be working there one day out of the week (the place I found is open Saturdays which works out since I work Mon-Fri), but do you think if I tell them I could make a 6 or 8 month commitment instead that that would be too short?

So just to re-iterate, what exactly is my question? My question is simply that I would like some opinion(s) on which action I should take and why. If any of you have questions for me in relation to all of this or a particular thing I touched on that you would like for me to elaborate on, feel free to ask. That being said, I am really looking forward to your help.

iphone8vsiphonex,t2_mmgiolj,1646586007.0,"This is my reflection to this question - and I'd love to also hear how you have dealt with situations where ""intent"" vs. ""impact"" has been different. 

I want to invite you to a brief exercise to hear some of your reactions - 

&lt;WELL-INTENDED PERSON&gt;
1. Think about the time that your well-intended message (whether action or words) had  landed (impacted) differently on other people. 

There can be so many examples from micro-level interactions (parent-child, partners, friendships, roommates, landlord-tenant, boss-employee) to societal level interactions (dem vs. republicans, between countries, even wars...)

What was it that you wish person who received the message  would do? Maybe, hoping that they would try to see it from their perspective? Maybe what you wanted to say was - ""I'm sorry it impacted you in that way - would you please also hear out my good intent and acknowledge it too?"" Because, emotions such as frustration, sadness, misunderstood, not seen arise - when we feel like our intended message has not landed the way I had intended. There's that longing, ""only if they can hear me out what I was TRYING to say...""

&lt;NEGATIVELY-IMPACTED PERSON&gt; 
2. Now, imagine that you were the person receiving your OWN same well-intended message that you had mentioned before; Whether it's the content or ""how"" the message was delivered, it just didn't feel great. 

What might be your longing? Perhaps - ""Yeah, I hear your good intent - but it didn't land well on me and I'm feeling a lot of things - I need you to hear me out how it landed on me. Please hear out what I'm trying to say"" 

---

In this world, I take on BOTH roles as an ""well-intended person who longs for understanding and empathy"" AND ""negatively-impacted person who longs for sensitivity and awareness of how the message may impact me."" While I felt stuck and frustrated at the inevitable reality that ""most communication is miscommunication,"" I feel hopeful that I am able to take on both perspective as well-intended vs. negatively impacted person - because it is also inevitable reality that I am continuously taking on both roles multiple times in one conversation. 

So, this makes me think - when my message has not well-landed, I can be humble and acknowelege the reality that I could have done better job of delivering the message, BECAUSE I KNOW what it feels like to be negatively impacted by the message, and apologize and descalate. 

Similarly, when I was negatively impacted by their well-intended message, BECAUSE I KNOW what it feels like to feel misunderstood and not seen by my well-intended message, perhaps I can extend empathy and see myself...that I was a few seconds before. 

Perhaps, one way to deal with the diff between ""intent"" vs. ""impact"" in communication is - to see myself in them, as much as we can.

jbtuckr,t2_3wpjz70z,1646568441.0,"I work for a cell phone repair shop, I‚Äôve worked at numerous throughout the years. A lot of places use the cheapest parts they can get, even if it‚Äôs from a reputable supplier, so here‚Äôs my advice on the best way to get your phone/tablet fixed with the best quality. 

Apple doesn‚Äôt sell its parts to consumers, so third party manufacturers make their own parts or refurbish previously broken ones. Newer phones use OLED panels which are superior in every way to LCD (quality, efficiency, thinness, etc). There are LCD aftermarket options out now for iPhones, but they don‚Äôt look as good, they MURDER your battery, and they don‚Äôt exactly fit the phone perfectly since they‚Äôre thicker height wise. Most 3rd party places use LCD instead of oled for iPhone repairs, I‚Äôve worked for a place before that charged the premium and ensured people it was OLED but it was LCD, and it felt like a sin for every repair I had to do. 
What to do: get an account with MonileSentrix (the biggest wholesaler), or Injured Gadgets (a few dollars more than MS, but have had less defective screens sent to us than MS recently). Just make up a fake business name and put your home address, no business ever checks if you‚Äôre legit. Then just buy your own part and bring it in. Every place I‚Äôve worked at charges $35 if someone brings in their own part but doesn‚Äôt offer a warranty (if it‚Äôs defective, you just exchange it yourself). We charge $60-100 for labor on repairs where we use our own parts, lots of places charge higher for newer phones. 

The plus is you get to ensure your part is the quality you want, and the labor cost is cheaper. An added bonus is you get access to discounted cool ass accessories the sites offer, and a bonus is depending on the phone, you can get a battery with higher mAh than factory since battery technology is constantly improving

Also to note, injured gadgets has something called InsiredGadgets liquid glass which is basically a $300 repair warranty you can get for the wholesale price of $25. I don‚Äôt use a case bc I use it and I‚Äôve cracked and gotten reimbursed for 4+ devices. Totally worth it. You can order literally any part imaginable for your device, with the OEM options being more expensive, but always better. 3rd party repair shops are great, but it‚Äôs a business and they cut corners to make the most money.

LPT: How Debt Collectors REALLY work

YSK: how debt collectors work

TL;DR, anyone can be one. 

&amp;#x200B;

Debt collectors are a misunderstood term. 

Without going into the moral responsibilities of paying a debt, debt collectors are people who call to attempt to collect a debt. 

Let's take a common example, and one I'm deeply familiar with, having worked on the CSR side.

Directv's sole goal was not selling equipment or services but contracts. 

However, locking a customer into paying for years on outdated equipment remains the only feeding tube keeping the company afloat. 

So in this example, we have a customer with an outstanding bill of 226.80 Pound sterling or $300. Directv will attempt several times to reach the customer before writing the debt off. 

Writing off the debt means Directv will claim the cost of the debt as an expense on their taxes as a business cost. 

A ledger of outstanding debts is then sent to a broker. 

The broker pays Directv for this list of customers 

The list of customers contains the phone number, email and name, and amount of debt. 

The broker then turns around and sells this list to a marketplace. 

Yes, a market exists for debts. 

At this marketplace which mainly exists as forums where people purchase credits to bid on lists, the winner gets to download the file of people to call. 

The quality of these lists depends on the company's stinginess that sold them. For example, in the case of Directv, there are many misspelled and incorrect entries **and no proof that the debt is valid.** 

Debt collectors then dial numbers in the excel sheet adding a row for profit. For example, if a debt is 300, they may attempt to collect 360 or 800. The game relies on the fraying memory of the people they are calling. 

When the phone is answered, they ask if they speak to the name matching the record. On their side, they are attempting to match a phone number with a name or ""validate"" a lead. Does this phone number work? Is the name right? they don't know. Their goal is to get a confirmation on a recorded line that ""yes that's me"" ""yes that's my debt.""

Do you want to frustrate a debt collector?

Announce your calls as front desk and ask who you can direct a call to. 

They don't want to deal with gatekeepers, and by becoming one, you are likely to end up at the very bottom of the list.  

Am I speaking with Jane Doe? 

You're speaking with the front desk. How can I direct your call?

Dispatch. How can I help?

Their main goal here is to **get a name**

they are looking at their sheet, checking if the person's name matches the  person on the line

Here's the thing about collection agencies. 

Once your debt passes into their hands, your debt is already sold off. So paying the debt makes *almost* no difference to your credit score. 

If the debt was given to a collections agency, it's already flagged as late. 

The only thing a collections company will do is notate that the debt was settled. 

Often they refuse to delete the collections item in exchange for deletion. 

Marking the debt as paid after falling into a collections agency does impact your score as the debt will be considered settled in good faith. However, the dirty truth is that time will do the same thing and entirely erase the debt from your score. 

In many states, debts have a statute of limitations. After that, it ""falls off"" your credit report meaning it displays only intense searches of your credit history, something that many companies do not do when they request your credit history. 

Credit history is a farce, a monopolistic series of companies that sell numbers and charts to other industries. Many companies purchase the cheaper versions of credit reporting tools, which display fewer results. 

Debt collectors prey on the scheme by attempting to take payments originally designed for a debt. The thing is, you're not paying the debt. You're not handing Directv their money for a broken contract. Instead, you're paying some snot-nosed teenager who paid for a debt collection license or is hired to make calls all day using a script to attempt to shake payments. 

Directv does not care about your payment. 

Your cell phone company already filed off your debt and sold it to this company. You are speaking with someone looking at a list of hundreds of names who will pretend that your debt matters when it doesn't. 

If you don't want to pay, the correct answer to a debt collector is to cause them pain. Look up the laws surrounding debt collections and use them to your advantage. If you've given your name, demand they send proof of the debt - frequently, they don't have it. If they ask your name, tell them you don't talk to strangers and hang up. 

You will be marked as someone who doesn't answer the phone. 

Alternatively, you can respond in confusion, claiming you have never heard of X company in your life, and they have no recourse. 

Don't bother leading with sympathy; debt collection callers have none or are well watered down. You are another caller on the list, nothing more and nothing less. Debt collection companies have some of the highest turnovers as people can't handle the soul tearing work, and polite refusal to talk (without indication of who you are) will be met with mute acceptance or continued interruptions from a recruit who still thinks they have a career. 

If you have already given your info to a collector, consider changing your number. After all, a dead lead is a dead lead, and many collectors will give up, although some of the most determined may now attempt to contact you via social media accounts. 

But in short, they can do nothing but beg you to pay. 

It is true that technically a debt collector can pursue a debt into court, but purchasing another list is much cheaper than court fees. 

People pay debt collectors thinking they are doing themselves a favor, that their collection will ""ruin their score"" and think that they are paying the original debt company.

We have a contract (though I‚Äôm not sure how much water it holds cuz I‚Äôm in the US and the business is in a different country).

verified_bs,t2_a155gzds,1646506751.0,"I absolutely love my dogs. I adopted my first one as an adult about 4 years ago. She‚Äôs a shedder but it was just her so keeping up with fur control was a task, but manageable. Pandemic hits and, like lots of folks, my children and I found ourselves at home with tons of time to spend with her. Once things started opening back up and my children were returning to school and I to work, I felt really bad for her since she went from having constant company for two years, to suddenly spending hours at a time home alone. So naturally, I did was any sane person would and got two puppies so my Lady pooch had company, and the pups had one another to play with when she was over them. Long story short, the manageable mess of hair became overwhelming very quickly. The floors were one thing, it‚Äôs easy enough to just sweep or vacuum real quick, but the hair in my bed, oh Lordy, it was unbearable. 

I couldn‚Äôt just not let them in my bed, so I spent our first few months together shaking out my bedding every night before I‚Äôd sweep my room, using a lint roller or a Lily brush and countless other methods to rid my bed of hair before I‚Äôd crawl into it at night. (They all have their own dog beds they sleep in. I have never let them sleep in my bed at night because I like my personal space and am not about to be fighting dogs every night for covers and real-estate in my own bed. I know some people don‚Äôt care and let their dogs sleep with them, but I am not one of those humans.) Needless to say, it became very time consuming and frustrating and made me dread bedtime, which was usually my favorite part of the day.

One day as I was switching my bedding over to wash what was on it, a light bulb went off. What if I make my bed as usual with my fresh, dog hair free bedding and then immediately cover it with a sheet? Game changer. Now at night time once I‚Äôve put them all to bed, all I have to do it pull the sheet on top off, and viola, I have a clean, *mostly* fur free bed to snuggle into. Then I can just take the sheet outside and shake it off before I put it back on the next morning. It saves me from having to wash my comforter as often as I do my sheets and I‚Äôm not breathing in dog hair all night. Definitely recommend giving it a try if you feel yourself getting frustrated with a furry bed but don‚Äôt want to give up snuggling with your pooches. (:

Ovian,t2_y1sf6,1646505054.0,"Okay, this might be something most people do anyways but I'm suprised that not many really do this.  
So what I want to say is you should do all of your daily tasks at work if possible instead of at home.  


I for exmaple started off with going to the toilet at work. If I wake up, I eat breakfast and just go to work before I even use the toilet at home. Even if I really have to use the toilet, I try to do it at work after I clock in.   
The thing is if you get to work 10 minutes earlier and just go to the toilet you can already clock in, but be on the toilet for 20 minutes and get paid 10 minutes for toilet using. And because you clock in early and your boss may see it, like my boss has, you will also get praised. My boss told me last week I get an extra day vacation for clocking in 10min early most of the time. What he doesnt know is that I am actually not productive.   


This is getting out of hand but since we have masks at work no one knows if I shave. So I now not only use the toilet, I also shave. It saves so much time at home I can sleep 5 minutes longer.   


Now you can actually or wait, you should(!) do this with as many activites as you can at your work. I for example did my daily quests in World of Warcraft in my paid breaktime at work when I still played WoW. Not only were those Quests boring, but I was able to do them at work when I was on break and had nothing to do.   
I clip my finger nails at work, I even put face masks on if I find time, I shave, I use the toilet, I prepare dough in our kitchen in case I want to make pizza, I clean my keyboard/ mouse that I bring from home at work, I clean my shoes, dunno whatever and so on.  


And when I get home I have so much free time. I even have my tooth brush at work hidden so I can just skip that at home as well.   


And you get paid for that. I think most people do this but I am thinking about projecting more and more daily tasks to my work place. I might as well just start sleeping there lol.",LPT: Try to do personal needs at your work as often as you can,LifeProTips,False,1.0,1.0,1.0

_____________________

#Stage One: The Honeypot.

Often times when you're that shy, soft-spoken person with a few neat quirks clammed up inside, the few times you show it, people *love* it. They'll shower you with compliments, bring you with them everywhere, and try show you off to others. And it's good at first, *really* fucking good. Those warm fuzzy feelings you  get down under are like Crack, and you'd do whatever it took to stay in their good graces to keep them coming.

But then you notice a few things off. Mainly how they kindly, almost talk *down* to you, as if you're a pet dog or hermit crab. But it's just one little nitpick, right? No need to jeopardize the dopamine gravy-train by making a big stink about that, right?

Wrong.

#Stage 2: The Bullying.

Then you begin to notice some other stuff. Their overbearing affection turns into a form of gentle ""bullying"", dragging you into stuff despite you being clearly uncomfortable. They tell you that they gotta ""build up your confidence"", and ""toughen you up a bit"". If you end up not enjoying whatever outing you got dragged into, they'll wave you off and dismiss it as you needing to be more confident and putting yourself out there. And in a vacuum, that makes sense objectively, so you put your feelings out of your mind and mentally whip yourself into accepting their increasingly brazen violations of your boundaries. 

Then the stinky half of this ""friendship"" starts to rear its head.

#Stage 3: Dr. Jekyll and Hyde.

All of a sudden, when they're in a bad mood, they let it *all* out on you or around you, without any regard to you feelings on the matter. Dirty looks when you walk in the room, a sigh here and there as if to tell you subliminally that you're a massive pest until you get the hint and leave the room. 

You notice that when they're talking to their other friends, everything is lively, but when you attempt to strike up a convo or simply say what's up, the mood instantly darkens.

All of your attempts to get to the bottom of this sudden attitude change and have a conversation about it are dismissed with excuses like ""Whaaat? I talk to you the same way I talk to everybody else. It's all in your head man."", or ""I'm always 100% real, and if I'm feeling some type of way, that's just the way it is. Fuck what anyone else says.""  You really start to get annoyed by this, but then you notice how they'll also confide in you a lot in their moments of vulnerability, so you write it off as them trusting you so much as a friend, that they don't feel the need to put up a front around you and can totally be themselves without worry. Your heart swells; you think you've found the homie.

Sorry pal, no ya haven't. 

#Stage Three; Rules For Thee, Not For Me.

So just like they've ""trusted"" you enough to let their guard down, truly be themselves around you for better or worse, and confide in you,  you think you can finally do the same around them. You let the protective social shell you encase  yourself in, and you start to goof off, and confide in them as well. And in the beginning, they love that; they celebrate it and applaud you for finally ""coming"" out of your shell and trusting them to be yourself around them.

Then suddenly, you're not allowed to do that anymore.

They roll their eyes and keepthe straighest poker face whenever you goof off or tell a joke, treating you like a pest again, which causes you to feel like unwanted company.

When they have an outburst or enforce their boundaries via harsh words or threatening ti open up a can of whoop-ass on someone else, it's all good, because they've got the right to do so, and they won't let anyone fuck around with them. 

Yet if you try to do the same thing? They'll clown you, laugh you out of the room, tell you to check yourself and remind you of all the things they've done for you, whilst conveniently glossing over the things you've done for them. They'll pull at your dependency on that friendly energy and affection, by saying that they don't need you and that if it wasn't for them taking you out, introducing you to others and hanging out with you, that you'd still be that shy kid with no pals. So they tell you to remember your place and never act out of pocket again.


If the above things apply to you, you are not their friend. You are their teddy bear.

People love, hug and cherish their teddy bears when they're happy, but will also spare no second thoughts punching, tearing apart and/or tossing them around the room when they're sad. Why? Because it's a fucking teddy bear.  The hell is it gonna do about it? It's sole purpose is t be a sponge for all of their emotions, good or bad.

But you are not a teddy bear. You are a fucking sovereign human being with the right to enforce your boundaries, and set a reasonable standard for the conduct of your friends around you.

No amount of love is worth a tax of disrespect, neglect or abuse of any kind, in any amount.

If you want something you have to ask for it or take charge of it yourself.
This applies to relationships, work, family, mental health, friends, -- basically any nominal interaction with other human beings falls under this category.

Example:  I have a co-worker who regularly asks for raises at work.  Every three months, he puts together a portfolio of successes, and presents it to the managers.  Basically a greatest hits reel.  He's a decent working, that's productive and professional.  No-one dislikes him, he does his job and treats others respectfully.  Normally this kind of work ethic would make someone completely invisible to management.   However, he's managed to secure more raises and promotions than other co-workers who have started at similar times.  Is it ""fair""?  No, but it illustrates the point.

When I first started dating, I didn't know how to ask for what I wanted.   I just rolled with whatever my partner wanted.  This didn't work well.  Once I started being respectfully assertive about what I wanted from a relationship, I was able to find a balance that I had never experienced before.   

Formulate the question in your mind, set the right frame to ask it in, and ask.  The worst someone can say is ""no.""   If you do it with careful consideration, you'll gain ""points"" for asking, even if the answer is ""no.""    This also gets you used to being rejected.

# ¬†How To Conquer Fear¬†

Fear is one of the toughest emotions that has a huge impact on the person's mind and life.it occurs as a mental response to a significant event,situation or even a thought.sometimes it is logical/rational, and sometimes it is only meant to hold us back from living life properly and taking action towards a positive change.

Fear is generally related to:1) constant thinking of what may happen,what could go wrong and our brains generating multiple possibilities by asking ""what if"".2)past trauma or old thinking pattern which convinces the person to stay in his comfort zone rather than experiencing intense or high levels of anxiety due to the unfamiliarity with the situation

So here are few ways to help you control your fear:

### 1-Awareness

our brains trick us into believing that our thoughts are the reality,and that's how we are deceived thinking that the image we created in our minds for certain things or situations is the reality when it's only a mental image made by our brains ,since the latter cannot distinguish between thought and reality.thus we need to understand that our fears are resulted from that mental image ,not from how things truly are.  


### 2-Facing and challenging

fear is the enemy of growth,it limits our creativity and desire for change and prosperity as it keeps convincing us that safety is good but risk and danger are bad.hence,it controls our life and how we live it,until we decide to control it by facing it even though it may feel uncomfortable and triggering.the process is called ""exposure""and it involves gradually going into feared situations until you feel less anxious.  


### 3-Change your perspective

everything we encounter in life is seen through our own lenses,which makes us reflect ourselves into everything,thus we can never perceive fear or anything else objectively without intervening our own identity.however we can work on changing our perspective about fear by changing how we define it.so if we see it as a positive thing that's going to helps us grow as a person,then our mind will be less triggered by it.  


### 4-Focus on the outcome

uncertainty and unfamiliarity with new situations and experiences fuels feelings of stress and anxiety,but when you decide to take that leap regardless of these feelings,you are allowing yourself to grow as a person and surpass obstacles that your mind has created to keep you in the same position.so the more you discredit your fear,the more it will be easier to move forward in life.  


### 5-Separate your present from your past

most of the times,our fears are generated from our past-traumas or past image of ourselves.the human brain is a social organ that is shaped by experience,so basically the specific fears created in your past will fool you to think that your current fears are real while it is just yourself resonating with old fear-triggering situations.  


### Conclusion

in the end,heavy disturbing emotions are part of us as humans so we need to get along and accept it before any attempt to get rid of it.in other words,it's not about removing your fear but it's about dealing with it in a way that allows you to control it .

The LPT is that shifting perspective in this way puts your self-esteem under your control. By knowing this, you can, when you notice a negative thought, choose not to engage in it any further.

I realized a crucial piece of information wasn't given to us and I thought I'd share it with everyone. These are some steps people should take in order to minimize the damage:

2) file a police report 

3) call Transunion and Equifax to put fraud alert on your credit asap. The scammers will try to use your IDs to sign up for new cards so signing up for alerts (paid service) helps a ton

4) you'll start getting calls from different institutions regarding a new application for a card. The companies that have a reliable system will check the credit union and deny the application; however, not all do. That's where the paid service comes in handy so you can check it daily and call back any company that looked up your credit

5) forward your mail!!.. If you're getting calls from all of the different companies then you can bet the scammers will try to come back to steal your mail! This critical piece of information was not given to us and our mailbox was broken into.

6) eliminate your account with the compromised bank. It's gonna be a long and an excruciating process to switch over your pre authorized payments but no other way around it

Lonely_Dumptruck,t2_1jfuyd8u,1646322432.0,"Hopefully this helps a few people. This is something I stumbled onto after years of frustrating negotiations with clients who were always trying to negotiate lower rates.  Following this strategy has allowed me to more than double my rates over the past few years.  May need adjustment for different fields, but some version of this should be applicable to most freelance work.  

Potential customers frequently want to talk about rates before defining the scope of work. This starts the discussion off on the wrong foot as it creates an unnecessarily adversarial relationship and frames the negotiation as zero-sum.  What a good customer really cares about is getting what they want within their budget. If you start the discussion by referencing what it is the customer wants, then you have several advantages:

1) you can arbitrarily reference a large scope of work, and anchor your desired rate in a high price as a reference point. A high initial reference point sets their expectations, making anything else feel low. Ex: 
Q: ""What are your rates to do (generic task that could have a wide range of implementations)?""
A: ""Well, that really depends on your budget and how big/fancy/extensive/complex your wants/needs are.  A previous customer wanted (high end expensive project), that ended up being $(high number) total.  If your budget is more limited, I'm sure we can find a solution that works within your range."" 

2) By focusing the discussion on scope, you are getting them to implicitly accept your rates.  Instead of arguing about rates, you are working together, helping them to find a solution that works within their budget.  This also makes them more likely to be relatively open about their actual budget. 

3) It spells out the scope of work up front (hopefully including any foreseeable eventualities) and guards against scope creep. Also sets a baseline expectation if the scope expands, cost will also. 

4) If you do decide to give someone a discount after negotiating the scope, the value will be better appreciated by the customer since they had already accepted your rates in principle.

5) It will weed out problem customers who a) don't really know what they want b) are planning to try to get extra stuff for free  c) are generally unpleasant or shady d) really just can't afford you.  In the long run, this is good for your business. The Pareto principle suggests that ~20% of your customers will cause ~80% of your problems.   Filtering out those customers in advance lets you focus your energy on doing better work for the good customers, ultimately justifying higher rates.  

Bonus tip: if contacted by a nonprofit, look up their 990 form and see what they're paying themselves before accepting the ""we're a nonprofit so we don't have the budget"" claim.",LPT: Negotiate scope of work rather than rates (freelancers),LifeProTips,False,1.0,1.0,1.0

Essentially I can move to a new city (which I have actually lived in before for 5 years - it consistently is in the top 20 livable cities in the world) to do the exact same job I do now for 30 - 40% extra pay.

 The reason I moved away and came home is because I found I was quite lonely in that city since my friends began working more and we drifted apart. 

However, I am finding that this is happening here where i grew up as my friends are also marrying off and having children. 

I also think to myself with the pay rise i can easily afford to fly back/visit without issue and its not that far away (maybe 3 hours round trip).

Poldark_Lite,t2_2eex1sxy,1646302931.0,"The reason this is important is that the pelvic floor weakens due to a variety of reasons, not least of which are **AGE** and **BEING OVERWEIGHT**. 

Prolapse itself is the protrusion of the rectum from the anus (men or women); or the protrusion of the uterus, bladder, or vaginal vault from the vagina. It can be caused by common diseases and conditions like diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), chronic constipation *or* diarrhea, childbirth, hysterectomy &amp;etc. 

Fortunately, you can begin to make a difference in your pelvic floor health immediately and help stave off this potential problem by doing Kegel exercises. Do the following whilst breathing normally: when you're urinating, pause midstream and hold *without tightening your abdomen or buttocks*. That's the same action/set of muscles to activate when doing Kegel exercises. 

Strengthening your pelvic floor can help improve your sex life, too! This exercise increases blood flow to the area and has the following benefits: 

**Men**

- It strengthens erections. 
- It makes ejaculation more vigorous.
- More than 6 in 10 men report an improvement in premature ejaculation. 

**Women**

- Natural lubrication increases. 
- Vaginal muscles relax, allowing it to expand more easily. 
- It makes reaching orgasm easier.

I've used computers basically my entire life, for 30+ years, my eyesight is normal. Most days I sit in front of a screen for almost all of the day, for work, and for fun.

Back some 5 years ago or so I started noticing eye strain with constant computer use and started to pay attention to things like ""eye care"" features in monitors, flicker-free and sufficient lighting in the room, blue-light filtering glasses, and overall tuning all kinds of things to reduce eye strain. I don't have glare issues.

I know all the basics, and that you should take breaks and look at other things regularly, but I've found it challenging to adopt in practice.

In the past couple of months it has gotten much worse again, some days I've basically felt like I have been welding without a mask, and a few days I was really unable to look at a monitor without instantly feeling pain in my eyes.

I tried some eye drops as well, but they didn't really do anything to me, but I dunno if some eye drops are better suited for the job than others.

&amp;#x200B;

**Request**

I've been trying to look into options I have, but would appreciate additional ideas and feedback.

The 25"" e-ink monitors from DASUNG and BOOX are interesting - I tried to hack something together with my reMarkable 2 using a remote desktop viewer to see if I could use e-ink but it was so much worse with all the hacks that like that I could not use it. However I still remain hopeful about these.

I also found some color e-ink Android tablets, which might work as a more general-purpose small device that I might at least be able to use for chatting, watching Youtube, etc. when I can't do anything else.

There's also some U.S. based (I'm in EU) company with ""RLCD"" monitors - apparently somewhat similar to e-ink for viewing properties, only Full-HD resolution for a 32"" monitor, but 60Hz and full color. If these could save me from the eye pain this might be the best option I can invest in.

This is the [seventh day of the war](https://www.pravda.com.ua/articles/2022/03/2/7327333/) in Ukraine. The enemy is so demoralized that it uses sneaky weapons to harm civilians.

The enemy [scatters](https://www.pravda.com.ua/news/2022/02/26/7326107/) mobile phones, backpacks, packages and even children's toys stuffed with explosives in crowded places of Ukrainian cities. You can't even lift them or even touch them!

The Center for Public Health [told you](https://www.facebook.com/phc.org.ua/photos/a.353782784746456/3751881984936502/) what to do if you come across a suspicious object.

**What should you do if you find a dangerous object?**

* Immediately call the police, the State Emergency Service or the territorial defense of your city or village. It is important to provide as accurate as possible the location of the probable explosive, as well as the date and time of its detection.
* If you have witnessed that an unknown person leaves suspicious objects, try to get a good look at it and remember the remarkable features: appearance, clothes, cars and his license plates.
* Tell other people about the dangerous find, especially those who are nearby. If possible, they should be evacuated from the potential site of the explosion.
* Do not approach, touch or shift a suspicious object. This can have irreparable consequences for your health or even cost your life.
* If possible, mark or enclose the place of discovery (for the fence you can use various improvised materials: boards, poles, branches, ropes, pieces of bright matter, etc.).
* It is also advised to stop smoking and the use of radio communications near the place where the alleged explosives are located.
* Try to provide a suspicious object with security that would monitor it until police, rescuers or representatives of the theroboron arrive. At the same time, it is necessary to be at a safe distance from a suspicious object.
