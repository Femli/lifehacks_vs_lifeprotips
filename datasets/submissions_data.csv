-finding a picture of the safe key and making a copy (couldn‚Äôt find one) 

- calling around to see if a place can open the safe (upwards of $2k) 

-the combination (won‚Äôt open or we‚Äôre doing it wrong üò£) 

info: 
- FireKing safe 
- key hole has numbers engraved in it 
- super old, not digital (the turn thing) 
- door handle  pushes up slightly when it‚Äôs open

1. Turn the dial clockwise and set
10 to triangular mark four times.

2. Turn counterclockwise and set
64 to triangular mark three times.

3. Turn clockwise and set 24 to triangular mark two times.

4. Turn counterclockwise and set 8to triangular mArk once

And the door is ready to oper. For the safe with a handle, turn it up.

start from the first step of the procedure.

You should be going no more than 25-30 mph over what the nearest lanes are going. This goes for parked cars in neighborhoods too since people will swing their doors open without checking for cars! 

If traffic is going 40 in one lane, you should not being doing 70 past them, it's plain unsafe. The only time you should reasonably be going 30 over them is if there is heavy traffic and you're in the only lane that's moving. Don't slow moving traffic down, but dont stop it entirely with an accident either. 

In America specifically there is a form of reckless driving called ""reckless overtake"" that is punishable by law as well. The speed changes between states, but under 30 is usually a safe zone for not getting pulled over in traffic. That number goes down when all vehicles are moving.

I can‚Äôt say anything about that but waking up early sure gives you a lot of time, and in my case, makes me feel much more active. But nobody can make you do something if you don‚Äôt want it, simple as that. If you do however, want to start your day early, just decide why and for what reason. I have been trying a new routine and getting up early is part of it which, in my experience, definitely makes me feel more productive and less lethargic throughout the day (but with coffee, ofc). 

**Sleep early:** Have an early dinner, and try to get into bed by none-thirty, max by ten. It may be difficult for any former night-owl, but it gets easier. 

**Make a to-do list:** Have a list of things you plan to do after getting up so you don't feel lost without a purpose and hence, more tempted to go back to bed. 

**Set an achievable goal (alarm):** You know yourself the best so you know it's not possible to suddenly wake up at five after sleeping till ten every day. Start by getting up by eight and then gradually set earlier alarms. 

**Keep your phone/alarm away:** Most important part- keep your phone/alarm at a place in your room where you'd have to leave the bed completely to reach it. That way when you hear the alarm you would have no choice but to climb out of bed, which is the hardest step, to even switch it off. Once you're up, the battle is nearly won!",Does waking up early help you?,lifehacks,False,0,1,1.0

- once finished cooking and have it situated in the pocket, nibble the end off of the end which you're going to start eating from to where it opens up the Hot Pocket
- do 5 long, hard blows into the Hot Pocket to get most of the heat out of it
- let it sit for a few minutes to let any excess heat escape

I also self sabotage a lot for the last 16 years as one of my coping mechanisms. The obvious solution is to seek mental help, which in my country comes down to either:

* go to church and get saved
* go to mosque
* you sound crazy so I am having you committed
* you sound crazy so I will get you medicated
* I know your family so pay me or I will release this info to them
* release info to outsiders (happens a lot)

And the one person whom I found to be professional charges an arm and a leg. I can only afford 1 session a month. 

My problem is that I start a business, get everything done, and then flake out for no real reason. Sure, sometimes there are external factors, but my response is the same. I just flake, give myself excuses and watch it crash and burn. 

I just started a new business and a supplier and distributor flaked. I want to be done with the whole thing, but I like the business. I don't have the mental tools to make the necessary next decisions to improve my odds of succeeding. What can I do?

Bawonga,t2_2wj9bpoq,1650629522,"\[ True story, not a joke.\] After I got home from a hike, I was sitting at the table and saw a tick embedded in my thigh a few inches from my knee. I assume he was still enjoying his meal (me) because he had sucked enough blood to be sllghtly swollen but not fully engorged. My panic level soared when I saw those whiskery little legs move, knowing that it was up to me to remove him, but I was alone, grossed out, and had never removed a tick before. I remembered hearing something about tweezers and hot matches and vaseline. Sounded like a 3-pronged torture plan worth trying, so I retrieved these from the kitchen and bathroom, returning to the table to sit and worry and begin extraction. But first, I needed to escape from the horror and calm down, so I smoked a joint. 

It was killer weed, and I hit it hard, trying to grow enough courage (actually, it made me more nervous, but now I was smiling and extremely high). What do you know? The little fucker started squirming and backed out of my leg, leaving his feast early. I say ‚Äúearly‚Äù because he hadn‚Äôt filled up with enough blood to swell up like a woman pregnant with quintuplets. After nudging him onto a piece of paper with the end of the tweezers, I ran (fast) to the bathroom and flushed him down the toilet. Side note: I didn‚Äôt use that toilet for about a week, certain he‚Äôd climb back to finish his meal. ‚Ä¶ So, my theory is that a safe (and fun!) way to remove an embedded tick is to get it super high so he leaves on his own accord, however, I haven‚Äôt found another ~~victim~~ tick trying to feed on me again to test the theory. If anyone else tries it out, I‚Äôd love to hear whether the tick got stoned, or just you.",Tick removal hack -- smoke a joint,lifehacks,False,0,1,1.0

ATX_rider,t2_inpgw,1650554216,"So according to reputable sources I (dude here) should drink almost a gallon of water a day. I bet I fall short of that, 99 days out of 100.

I also live in a hot environment (Austin), ride a bike 3-4 days a week for fitness (and sweat profusely while doing so) and drink alcohol‚Äîall bad when it comes to staying hydrated.

I know all of the benefits of drinking enough water (better digestion, better skin, better sleep, less anxiety, weight loss, avoidance of kidney stones, etc.) and I've seen people with those massive containers sitting on their desk, but somehow that has never motivated me. There's ""the knowing"" and then there's ""the doing""‚Äîwe can all struggle with this gap at times, right?

About a week ago I remembered having read an article about the benefits of drinking apple cider vinegar and so I tried it by pouring about a half an inch into a pint glass and then topping it off with water. Despite the ratio it was pretty tough to drink so every chance I had to further dilute the mixture I did so by adding more water. 90 minutes later I had easily downed three pints of water‚Äîwhich is a great start to having a good day hydration-wise.

I've done it every day since and I've lost weight, my digestion has improved and I'm sleeping better. I know there are some potential drawbacks to drinking apple cider vinegar long-term but maybe I can establish a good water drinking habit before I have to give it up.

To the pediatrician for local anesthetic and an attempt to drain before hospitalization became necessary. I cleaned and bleached daily until exhaustion trying to kill that stuff off surfaces in my home. This was a 3.5 year fight for their lives!!! Bleach baths, washing linens daily, doorknobs etc etc. I wish I would have known then what I know now. I‚Äôve been using an HOCl maker in my house for a few months. Research proves this is the most effective disinfectant on so many levels. You can humidify rooms with it. (Cover electronics!) wash foods (no rinse needed!) clean your skin especially eyes, put in laundry, clean surfaces, bathe pets and it goes on and on. It‚Äôs not harmful in any aspect to us or animals! There is no chemical smells or worry of skin irritation. It kills tons of viruses, bacteria, fungi even parvovirus, staphylococcus and covid!!! I always concerned about chemicals leaving toxic residue around the house and that is no longer a problem. If you work in the medical field, this is a perfect safe way to help keep your home environment safe. It‚Äôs also super cost efficient!! Buying an HOCl maker can range from $80- $300. I bought mine for $120 and it will pay for itself in just months! I just wanted to share this because what I went through years ago was draining and I felt hopeless.

babib652,t2_a1wi6akt,1650423613,"So my apartment building is about 40 years old, and the water heater in the Apartment is the SAME one since it was first built. About a year ago the heating elements blew out on it. They replace it, 3-4 months later it blows out, etc. Rinse and repeat about 4-5 times. Finally it goes out and that's it. They try to change the heating element for the 5th time to hold me over another 3-4 months but, no luck. That 40 year old water heater has finally passed away after decades of reliable service. 

Now for whatever reason, water heaters are NOT easy to come by lately. After the guys left they said they'd have to back-order one. Seriously, you can't just go to lowes or something and grab one? It has to be back-ordered?! OK whatever.

So in the meantime i've been taking these ice cold showers for the past 2 weeks. Here's how i did it without losing my mind. 

Step #1- Angle showerhead directly downward. 

Step #2- Sit down in the shower, knees all together, in tightly huddled position.

Step #3- Brace yourself. 1....2...3....

Step #4- TURN THAT BITATCH ON FULL-BLAST, PAIN IS FOR DA WEAK!!

Step #5- ENDURE IT! ""AAARRGGGHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!"" And give it about 4-5 searing, ice-cold minutes. 

\^\^ Kinda like jumping into swimming pools as a kid, you know it's gonna be cold as frak at first but, you learn to just dive in and let your body get desensitized to it. And it's like my mind would block out the transition points. I remember one moment i'd go from shaking uncontrollably as i was blasted by the Arctic streams, to calmly contemplating about how i'll handle issues at work. 

So after nearly 2 weeks, i get a text from my apartment office manager that they'll be over tomorrow morning to install a new water heater. Holy hell.",Water-heater broken: How to take ice-cold showers consistently without losing your mind....,lifehacks,False,0,1,1.0
ThatOneEpicAstronaut,t2_l3qbkvhk,1650421545,"**TL;DR:**  
The reason behind this is kinda personal, so I won't say it. In the past (I think last month), I was able to wake up at 3:00 AM continuously every single day without sunlight and alarm. Only pure motivation and repetition. But nowadays, even with my old method, I still can't wake up on time. I have tried repeating it every single day, but it doesn't work now. There are some days where I am very motivated that I even woke up at 2:00 AM or 3:00 AM, but after that, I don't anymore. I tried 4:00 AM, and I woke up at 5:00 AM. I really need to do master this, so please don't give comments like ""You need to get 8 hours of sleep"", ""Just keep doing it (That's not the purpose of this post)"", ""Try this app \_\_\_"", ""Use an alarm clock"", ""get someone to wake you up"", ""Put your phone on the other side of the room"", etc.  


Again, the reasons are kinda personal. I would really like to hear your thoughts/tips/advice about this one, thank you!

I always exercise after I wake up to stay awake, that's why in the past, even without an alarm clock &amp; sunlight, I can still wake up with full energy.

ilustrado,t2_i5cl1,1649948711,"I used ExpressVPN for this since my main VPN (Mullvad) doesn't have an Indian server yet. You can even use a free VPN for this if you want, since you'll be using fake information anyway and won't risk anybody eavesdropping on the payment to get your card details.  


1.) Connect to Indian VPN using your provider of choice.

  
2.) Use Firefox, not Chrome. Chrome, for whatever reasons, does not work (likely due to the data Google collects on you)

  
3.) Download Privacy on your phone (No VPN needed on your phone). From their website: 

&gt;Privacy gives you control over who can charge you  and how much. Create virtual payment cards for one-time purchases or  subscriptions, directly from your browser or phone. Set spend limits, pause,  unpause, and close cards any time you want. 

*Full disclosure, this is my affiliate URL. I'm not going to try and be sneaky and just hyperlink it here, but the only reason why I include it is you do get a $5 credit applied to your account if you accept someone else's invite, and since I'm sharing this method, I'd appreciate anybody using it. If you don't want to for whatever reason, no hard feelings, just remove the code at the end:* [**https://www.privacy.com/join/MNSNG**](https://www.privacy.com/join/MNSNG)

4.) After linking your card, generate a disposable debit card with a set spending limit of what you expect to pay (I usually just choose $5, and it'll get charged the $1 for the month, then you can close the card if you want. Or, just select a prepaid 3/6 month plan and adjust the cards limit accordingly.) If you don't do this, it's very likely your card will be declined by your bank.  


5.)  Go to [youtube.com/premium](https://youtube.com/premium) and notice that it is now displaying the price in Indian Rupees, 129 a month. That converts to 1.69 (nice) a month. 

6.) Input your Privacy card details on checkout, and for address, just use any random address from [https://www.bestrandoms.com/random-address-in-in](https://www.bestrandoms.com/random-address-in-in)  
7.) You should get redirected to a page that says your card is not from india, so the payment processor may charge your card a few extra cents. It'll convert the price to USD and show you before you pay.  


8.) Complete the payment,  and enjoy your dirt-cheap premium!  


Some  may see this as unethical, but I find it extremely ethical. Frankly, you're already paying more than you think with all the data Google collects and sells about you. To have non-stop ads on every video you watch is just Google being greedy.   


This method has been around for a very, very long time, and nobodies been banned for it. The address does not need to be connected to your debit card, and due to a lack of KYC, it's all irrelevant information anyway. Some people claim to have just input obviously fake information, or their real information with an indian zip code, etc etc, and it still works.  


Just thought I'd share since I just got 3 months for $4 and couldn't be happier! Everything is working flawlessly. If you're \*really\* concerned about repercussions, you're free to make a new account ,but people have reported using this for years and absolutely no issues. You're free to disconnect your VPN immediately after payment and your Premium will still be active even on your home connection.","Want YouTube Premium, but don't want to spend the ridiculous $12 a month?

I‚Äôm 31. My whole life I‚Äôve had a toxic relationship with credit cards, as do many people. Dig yourselves in a deep hole at 18 that you can‚Äôt get out of. These past few months I‚Äôve paid off some, and a couple more to go, but while thinking differently about it.   

Bills in general would come due various times throughout the month, so to keep track I would heavily use my phones calendar to plot those dates. It was stressful to coincide income to those dates. Internet is due the 12th, oh but we get paid four days later! I did this for my 13 adult years. Very exhausting.

I then had a conversation with someone and they pay their bills by setting autopay to one or two cards for most things they got - internet, cell, rent, etc. they don‚Äôt have forty bills to remember, only about two or three. The more that‚Äôs automated, the more you can avoid the headache of planning, plus everything is paid on time. Ensure you pay balance by statement time and you avoid interest fees.

An addition to this revelation can be further exploited by applying for new cards that offer cash back. I got a Wells Fargo card and for every dollar spent, 2.2% is kicked back (minus gambling and advanced transfers). Math says for my monthly expenses of $4,161 (excl those that credit card can‚Äôt pay) x 2.2% x 12 months means a cool $1,098 a year in rewards. That‚Äôs a good round trip pair of flights.

I have a pretty big sweet tooth and LOVE Sweetarts. They are sweet, sour, crunchy....just the perfect treat. After sucking on a handful a few weeks ago I noticed that my tongue looked perfectly pink! I usually have an issue with my tongue looking white and couldn't figure out how to fix it. But after I eat about ten Sweetarts my white tongue issue is gone and my tongue stays perfectly pink for about 3 days afterwards!

This morning my tongue was white again so I re-tested this discovery and after a handful of Sweetarts this afternoon, my tongue feels cleaner and looks pinker!

I'm guessing the sourness in candy must kill off something on the surface of the tongue. My only reccomendation is Sweetarts from direct experience but I'm sure you could try other candies too.","Suffer from ""white tongue""? Try sour candy!",lifehacks,False,0,1,1.0

We push it room-to-room. Need to vacuum? Push the cart. See a trash item in that room or something that needs to be dusted? Just toss it in the trash or grab the duster! We have a 2 year old who is a sock thief &amp; this has helped with keeping track of our socks.

SPon23567,t2_3x73kndk,1648980256,"This is a bit of an interesting little life hack that nets you free food, condiments, desserts, and whathaveyou. 

The restaurant City Barbeque always has a giant backstock of sauce, desserts, whipped cream (like actual whipped cream not the canned stuff), and even drinks like sweet tea. Around 15min to closing or at closing you can often arrive and ask if they have anything they are going to toss that you could take home instead, and they will just hand you a shite ton of sauce or whipped cream or whatever. 

If you need or want food and can't afford it for a short time, and want to help cut down on the amount of waste being put in landfills AND wasted food (because otherwise they just literally throw it in the trash), you can always show up and ask them if they are able to give you anything they planned to toss. 

Other places like wing zone/wingstop often have sweet tea they plan to chuck and you can just ask them. On one occaision I went home with 9 containers of sauce and whipped cream free from CB and on another they sent us home with literally 6 tubs of peach cobbler. 

This is legit a useful lifehack because many people do not know that businesses will often let customers take home certain items they would otherwise end up throwing out.

YouAreAGoodDogDug,t2_keydf0zo,1648702382,"There are several reasons why a bed could require changing during the night ‚Ä¶and it‚Äôs extra hard to do when you‚Äôve been yanked out of Dreamland.   There‚Äôs something you can do to make changing those sheets easy, no matter what the time!  Make the bed in layers that can be taken off to reveal clean sheets.  Here‚Äôs how:  Put a waterproof mattress pad down, make the bed as usual with sheets.  Add another waterproof mattress pad or waterproof pads and add another set off sheets.  When there‚Äôs a late night accident, you will simply remove the wet sheets and waterproof mattress pad and voila!  A clean, made bed, ready for using.  

If you want to make the bed, so that multiple accidents can happen without changing the sheets, consider buying one size larger sheet sets for the upper layers.  This will accommodate the extra size of the multiple sheet sets underneath them.  

For kids who provide wet spots consistently in the same place, consider using a draw sheet with doggy pee pads (unscented) underneath.  Place a doggy pee pad where the spot is expected then take a top sheet and fold it in half, lengthwise.  Put the folded sheet over the pee pad and tuck the sides in on both sides of the bed, so that the sheet is snug, keeping the pee pad in place.

It may feel silly to go to the gym and not sweat, but I promise that if you‚Äôre consistent this will work. 

After a couple days you‚Äôll probably notice that you want to do a little more than just walk for an hour‚Ä¶ maybe you start challenging yourself see how many miles you can fit into the hour. 

Eventually (once the hour EVERY DAY) becomes part of your normal routine, you‚Äôll find yourself actively wanting to try other exercises to fill up your gym time, ***and it will be enjoyable.***

Start will the lowest weights you can. It will feel silly to bench press 5-10lb dumbbells at first, but again‚Ä¶ you‚Äôll find yourself wanting the additional challenge later. 

Then you might start challenging yourself to eat better, as to not ruin all the work you‚Äôve been putting in at the gym.

When we get tired, our first instinct is usually to quit or withdraw altogether. But sometimes, a good rest is all that we need.

And even after sleeping 9-10 hours of sleep, if you are feeling tired, you might try one these 7 different types of rest:

‚úÖ Physical Rest: This is your body telling you that you need to slow down. Think sleeping, taking a nap, doing some light stretching‚Ä¶  
 ‚úÖ Emotional Rest: We all carry heavy emotional loads on our shoulders. Do you have someone around you who might help you carry yours?  
 ‚úÖ Social Rest: Sartre was right. Sometimes, hell is other people! You might use some me-time to recharge.  
 ‚úÖ Mental Rest: Staring blankly at the same page for 10 minutes straight? You might need a mental break. Get away from that task.  
 ‚úÖ Creative Rest: You are not what you create. Allow yourself to just take in the beauty around you, instead of constantly striving to create something of your own.  
 ‚úÖ Spiritual Rest: Don‚Äôt necessarily think of a religious one. Just try to get re-connected to the bigger picture in your life.  
 ‚úÖ Sensory Rest: Minimize the sensory inputs around you. Close your laptop, put aside your phone and go for a walk.

Forward to 4 months ago, when 2 things happened simultaneously. My bank locked me out of my account, because my Federal Name didn't match what was on the account, and my Driver's License needed to be renewed. I found that I couldn't renew it until I changed my name Federally. Social Security explained what documents I needed, including a valid, current ID. Which I couldn't get without my name being changed with Social Security.

Add to all this that my Social Security Office isn't open to the public still, (unless it's an immigration issue), and I had to do all of this via the phone, (3 hours on hold, each time, on average), or online. It was such a nightmare, (including my puppy chewing up my Legal Copy of my Marriage Certificate), that could have been avoided, had I just changed my name with Social Security right after I got married. I had no idea.

I ended up getting a signed note from my Dr, stating that I am in fact, me, along with the rest of my paperwork. I also learned that Social Security will accept a signed Dr's note, verifying your identity. 

4 stressful months later, I'm back to being me, with the License that proves it.","LPT: When you change your name, like getting married or divorced, you need to change your name with Social Security, (Federal Government), as well as your Driver's Livers/ID, (State Government).",LifeProTips,False,1,1,1.0

Something I noticed a long time ago is people who use a lot tend to have more problems with acne and more problems with dirt and smells clinging to their clothes or problems with their clothes not washing very thoroughly clean. You don't need it, it doesn't do anything good, it just leaves a film on them and in the drum of your dryer. You especially don't want it on your pillowcase if you have problems with acne.

Ever wonder how your clothes still smell like flowers after they've been washed? Or ever used a laundromat and noticed that black gum-like buildup in the drum of the dryer? That's wax. Your clothes won't breathe as they should, you'll have more problems with b.o. dirt will cling and water and soap will have a more difficult time penetrating the fibers and eventually your clothes will smell like ""you"" not matter how much you wash them. Its a huge waste of money, but I know a lot of people who refuse to believe it causes any problems because that's just how they've always done laundry and think it's essential for some reason.

wiseoldmeme,t2_11rpai,1650981733,"This just happened to me. I bought some furniture with a 0% interest for 2 years promotion. The catch on all of these types of promotions is that if you don‚Äôt pay it off before the promotion expires you get hit with all the interest accrued since you made the purchase. The real interest rate is always some ungodly number you dont pay attention to when you are enticed by a promotion like this. I figured I would make 24 equal payments and take advantage of this promotion and it seemed so easy. So i set up my autopay which showed me that if I paid the minimum payment, which happened to be my total divided by 24 exactly then I would pay off this loan before the promotion expired. Great. So I set my autopay to ‚Äòminimum payment‚Äô and proceeded to forget all about this loan for the next two years. I am guessing that some of you already know where I fucked up. So I‚Äôm a busy guy I have a family and my credit card bill is usually very long and I tend not to keep track of repeating payments if I think that I‚Äôve already got them all squared away. What I didn‚Äôt notice was that over time the ‚Äòminimum payment‚Äô for this loan was decreasing. So when 24 months had passed I had not in fact paid off this loan. I didn‚Äôt realize this. I had completely forgotten how many months had gone by. I knew in the back of my head this loan should be expiring soon so the next email statement I received i actually opened it (which I never do). I was flabbergasted to see not only was the loan not almost paid off but my balance had increased by over $2500. I had passed the 24 month mark and since the loan was not paid off I was hit with all of the interest. What I should‚Äôve done when I set up my auto pay was to specifically type in how much I wanted to pay each month. Selecting ‚Äòminimum balance‚Äô screwed me. Now, I was very fortunate As I caught my fuck up within 30 days of the date when the interest hit my account. I was able to negotiate with the bank to pay off my loan without all of that additional interest.

No_Salamander_6579,t2_8s3w7rhx,1650975268,"The younger you are, the better! Live at your parents so you can weather the occasional bad month? Even better. Sales is inarguably the quickest way to make the most money from an entry level perspective when joining a company. What‚Äôs even better, you can parlay this level of earnings into better positions with more guaranteed pay down the road. Once you‚Äôve established that level of earnings. For example, if you make 75k (salary + commission) on a sales job that pays $30k salary, you could start looking for the next job that offers $75k salary plus commissions. Or a job that doesn‚Äôt involve sales at all, but you now have the experience and W2 (American version of tax slip confirming annual earnings) to negotiate that level of salary. 

To any of you reading thinking ‚ÄúBut I hate sales.‚Äù Or ‚ÄúI could never sell anything.‚Äù More than likely, what you hate is the ‚Äúperception‚Äù of what you think a sales person is. Are there some people who are slimy stereotypical ‚Äúcar salesman‚Äù? Of course. But really how you should approach sales is identifying what a customer‚Äôs problem is and how you could resolve that problem with your product/service. And if you can demonstrate some ROI (return on investment) with your solution, be it financial or other means, to that customer? Perfection. That should even be part of your pitch when meeting with clients - ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt really have much interest trying to ‚Äúsell‚Äù you anything, but if you give me a list of your pain points as a business, I‚Äôd love to see if we could help fix some of your issues with our products.‚Äù 

How to get hired? 
Sales is unique in that you really don‚Äôt need to have any tangible skills, you just need to be able to communicate. In any interview setting (again, this is geared towards entry level - some sales jobs can be very technical and require several levels of experience) be sure to hit on the following points when describing yourself:

You‚Äôre a head hunter - you get a thrill chasing down new business.
You‚Äôre a team player - you‚Äôll do whatever is asked, a collection of ideas is always better than just your own. 
You have an insatiable thirst for learning - of your product, of the sales process, of human nature and people in general. You are very coachable and welcome critique, as you feel it will only help you become a better sales person (which means more money!)

How do you make a sale?
It really comes down to three easy questions:
What are your pain points/ reasons for us meeting today? (*If lead given appointment, not pounding pavement generating new business). 

Who all is involved in the decision process? If they mention anyone other than themself, ask when that person would be available to ensure you‚Äôre all on the same page (This helps you identify who will actually be signing the check , so you don‚Äôt waste time on middle men with no real actual decision making ability). 

What is your budget and timeline for this project? This helps you quantify the opportunity. 

Can sales be hard? 
YES! Full stop. People will waste your time, give your business away at the last minute, and occasionally lie to your face. But you know what else can be hard? Literally every other job, with a fraction of the pay, and no room for advancement. It‚Äôs not for everyone BUT everyone can do it. So if you aren‚Äôt happy with your current earnings, what do you have to lose?

There are countless vertical markets that hire entry level sales positions. Nothing in life is guaranteed, but if you hit on the points above in the interview, and keep those three questions in mind on every sales call, there‚Äôs a strong chance you will get the job and do well!

francisxavier12,t2_11uwpo,1650974989,"There are videos on YouTube basically explaining step by step how to do any repairs or regular maintenance your car might need. I got my oil changed the other day, and before I got my car back, the dealership said I needed new air filters. They were going to charge me $75 EACH to replace my cabin air filter and my engine air filter. 

I bought the pieces on rockauto.com, and for $22 including shipping, I was able to get the parts, look up how too replace them, and once they arrived, replaced them in less than 10 minutes. 

This inspired me to start changing my own oil and other light maintenance from now on. This saves money and time, and gives me the feeling of satisfaction that comes with doing your own work.

ExoticCommunication,t2_1m8xz0hz,1650944497,"Early in my career I often wondered why I kept striking out with my job hunt. It took me a longer than I‚Äôd like to admit that I wasn‚Äôt doing a great of job searching. As I near 40 and now do hiring and team management myself, I‚Äôve learned lessons from both sides of the experience. While your mileage may vary for your individual career path, a lot of this advice is generalize and can be resized to fit. Feel free to pick and choose whatever you find useful, but I can say with some confidence that all of this has helped me have a very cool, diverse career for the past 15 years.

**Define yourself and your career narrative**: Everything else follows from this. Who are you? What do you want to do next? We can all better define the narrative of our career and that takes practice and refinement.

One of the most disappointing interviews of my career was an early post-grad interview where the interviewer straight up told me that she couldn't make sense of my story. Sure, I studied a lot and could possibly do a lot of things, but I was so disordered in my self-story that she just couldn't figure out what I'd be able to do for her team.

Don't be me. Define your narrative. What does that mean? Simply put, it means being able to say succinctly who you are and what you bring. For instance in my case: ""I'm a partnerships leader who helps run teams who develop new partnerships, lead deal negotiations, and serve as the organizational glue between internal and external stakeholders."" I obviously provide more, but for what I do that gets me the first five minutes of attention.

The more you practice defining yourself and your story the more confident you will be. There is no shame in introspection.

**Resumes are tricky, so don't hesitate to get yours scrutinized:** Resumes suck. They all suck. They're a way oversimplified distillation of everything you do, but they're often the first look someone has at who you are. Make sure your resume speaks to your narrative of who you are, but most importantly: DON'T LEAVE ANY TYPOS. You have no idea how many resumes I've reviewed with obvious glaring typos. Please, don't do that.

**Make your public persona shine:** I realize that not everyone is on LinkedIn, but everyone has an online presence to some degree now. I STRONGLY recommend having a high-quality LinkedIn profile if you are applying to any ‚Äúoffice-type‚Äù job. I look at the LinkedIn profiles of everyone I interview and look for any additional context about that person compared to their resume. I don‚Äôt think everyone needs to have the best LinkedIn profile ever, but don‚Äôt skimp on having your LinkedIn tell a consistent story about who you are and what you‚Äôre capable of doing. Trust me, both recruiters and hiring manager will pay attention. And please make your photo flattering-- if you can, pay for a professional headshot. Worst case it becomes your Slack icon.

**Practice interviewing with alumni or friends with more work experience:** Most colleges/universities provide at least some access to alumni who are willing to help mentor you in your career. Take advantage of that and do mock interviews. Tons of them. Get feedback, be humbled and take the time to be introspective as you get feedback. Not all of it will be equally helpful, but treat it like you would any other interview and hear out the mock interviewer and their feedback for you. One fun bit of advice I got early? Stop biting my cuticles in interviews. Yep. That was a fun one to get. And since then I've learned to apply some hydrocortisone to my fingertips that are peeling so I have less of an urge to nibble. Little things, eh?

**Please don't slack off with recruiters:** Recruiter screens might seem like a formality but they're really not. Recruiters can be your best advocate or they can push to have you nixed early. They are an important first and last step in the process. Do NOT think they're simply there to read your resume and ask questions. They often help the hiring manager from start to finish and can have tons of power over your hiring process.

**There is no perfect job, there is only the right job for right now:** I have worked for some of the coolest, best-known companies on Earth. And I've left every one of them at some point. There is no perfect job, no perfect boss, no perfect role. Don't think that because you didn't get something this time that you are any less worthy. I got told multiple times at one job that I wasn't a people manager. I now manage people. I've been told I wasn't a partnership manager. I'm now a director-level partnerships manager. I've been told I don't know how to manage software lifecycle. I now help manage huge gaming franchise lifecycles.

Above all: it's just a job. No job will ever be perfect, and it's okay to not get it right now. There's always another job.

eren_yeagermeister,t2_4a8yvtju,1650901306,"As a musician and performer, I want to address something that has been bothering me that I hope people will understand. It has to do with complimenting musicians. One of the most common phrases I hear after a concert, or performance, or release is ""why are you doing x (like playing in a bar)?"" And ""why aren't you famous yet?""   While I understand that it is meant as a compliment and meant to show the idea of ""you have talent, how is it possible you haven't gotten the recognition you deserve?"", the way it really comes across is ""what you're doing isn't good enough"".  

For example, I'm a teacher. I love educating. I also love performing. So when someone says ""why are you stuck HERE and not doing THIS"", it implies that I've made wrong choices and haven't tried my best.  ALL musicians are trying their best. So when people ask ""why aren't you famous?"", it really makes us feel like we haven't lived up to our potential. No one likes to feel that. It reminds us of failure and lost or unavailable opportunity. 

I felt this a lot when I was doing dueling pianos. Every night, and I'm sure my other dueling friends will attest to this, people will ALWAYS ask ""why are you in a place like this?"". As if I wouldn't take an opportunity of something much bigger if it wasn't presented. It's disingenuous and discouraging. 

So I ask any time you see a musician or performer that impresses you, just compliment their ability. Don't question to them why they are where they are as if it's not good enough for you.  Give positive reinforcement. Let them know their merit speaks for itself and it doesn't matter if they're playing for tips in a bar or performing on national TV. Support us for where we are.

A short summary of her symptoms and issues followed by:
* The date of her last doctors appt.
* Doctors name
* What the Doctor said
* What tests the Doctor ran
* What the results were (and I brought copies of the results and the physical results from tests. IE X-rays or CDs with MRIs. Doctors don‚Äôt like to just read the reports they usually want to see the X-rays etc themselves) ALWAYS get a physical CD copy or X-RAY of tests done. Ask before you leave the doctor or hospital.
* Any medications provided and what the results were.

Now every time we have an appt I show up to the next doctor with a copy of this info. 

This helped in 2 ways. It gave them a very quick idea of what was going on and it let them know they are going on this list so they should take the time to give us proper care.

epicllama0,t2_ih1tniyv,1650888668," Looking for a summer job this year? Here are a few words of advice.

If you come in person to interview or just to get an application, dress nice. Not saying you need a suit and tie to apply for a lifeguard position, but wear decent pants and a nicer shirt (ie: a polo shirt), not ripped jeans and a dirty ""420 YOLO SWAG"" shirt.

When you are talking to people look them in the eyes and engage them. I can't tell you how many people come in to apply for a job and look at their shoes the entire time and mumble responses to my questions.

Make sure your application is readable. I have shit for hand writing but when I was filling out applications it looked like I got an A+ in hand writing class. If I can't read it, I won't hire you. On the same vein, answer ALL the questions. Don't leave half the application blank and expect anyone to call you back.

Put the cell phone away. If you are waiting for someone that is fine, but when someone is talking to you put it away and don't bring it out again until you leave.

If you have questions about hiring, the position, or if there is any word on your application make sure that it is you that is calling, not mom or dad. It is a sign of maturity and that you are responsible enough to follow up yourself. It is a huge red flag if mom is calling me every day to ask questions for you or to push me to give you a job.

source: I do HR at a decent size country club and have been doing the hiring for the last few years and have reviewed more than enough terrible applications and candidates.

Will add some extra good advice as well:

\*Use a blue or black pen to fill out an application.

\*Don't bring friends with you to apply.

\*Have a professional email address, not [fingerbanger666@gmail.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20130523070931/mailto:fingerbanger666@gmail.com)

\*If possible hand an application to the manager not an employee.

\*Don't show up when we are running around like mad people expecting anyone to talk to you or remember you.

\*Don't apply too early (we forget about the application) or too late. Try and think of a reasonable time to apply, sorry it is vague advice.

\*Don't be late and don't have a poor excuse.

\*Know how to shake someone's hand.

\*Be confident when you are applying in person.

I took this declaration as gospel because he was older and cooler than me. I lived by those words for twenty years and they were etched into my brain as a Rule of the Land, spoken by a wise man in my formative years.

As time went on and I experienced life as a broke college student got more conscious about wasting food and would occasionally give it a try. Maybe they'd changed their recipe. Maybe the fries just needed more salt. Nope, heated up McDonalds was, still, officially BAD. I'd mentally kick myself for questioning the Holy Gospel until the next time my empty wallet got the better of me. 

Until yesterday. I stumbled across a life hack, nothing complicated, nothing special. Just one line.

""You can save heated up McDonalds if you put it in the microwave with half a mug of water, it'll come out crispy"".

Everything I thought I knew about the world was on the line. I put my burger and fries on a plate, filled half a mug with water and placed it in the center. 50 seconds. Would the law finally be broken? Would this forever change the rule of the land?

I sat down and took a bite. Took another few bites to be sure. And I have to say I've reached a disappointing verdict, the law still holds true. It is BAD.

alfredo0spallina,t2_ifti5eyd,1650880117," The Federal Trade Commission (FTC), the nation's consumer protection agency, is warning consumers to be on the alert for scam artists posing as debt collectors. It may be hard to tell the difference between a legitimate debt collector and a fake one. Sometimes a fake collector may even have some of your personal information, like a bank account number. A caller may be a fake debt collector if he:

‚Ä¢is seeking payment on a debt for a loan you do not recognize;

‚Ä¢refuses to give you a mailing address or phone number;

‚Ä¢asks you for personal financial or sensitive information; or

‚Ä¢exerts high pressure to try to scare you into paying, such as threatening to have you arrested or to report you to a law enforcement agency.

If you think that a caller may be a fake debt collector:

‚Ä¢Ask the caller for his name, company, street address, and telephone number. Tell the caller that you refuse to discuss any debt until you get a written ""validation notice."" The notice must include the amount of the debt, the name of the creditor you owe, and your rights under the federal Fair Debt Collection Practices Act.

If a caller refuses to give you all of this information, do not pay! Paying a fake debt collector will not always make them go away. They may make up another debt to try to get more money from you.

‚Ä¢Stop speaking with the caller. If you have the caller's address, send a letter demanding that the caller stop contacting you, and keep a copy for your files. By law, real debt collectors must stop calling you if you ask them to in writing.

‚Ä¢Do not give the caller personal financial or other sensitive information. Never give out or confirm personal financial or other sensitive information like your bank account, credit card, or Social Security number unless you know whom you're dealing with. Scam artists, like fake debt collectors, can use your information to commit identity theft ‚Äì charging your existing credit cards, opening new credit card, checking, or savings accounts, writing fraudulent checks, or taking out loans in your name.

‚Ä¢Contact your creditor. If the debt is legitimate ‚Äì but you think the collector may not be ‚Äì contact your creditor about the calls. Share the information you have about the suspicious calls and find out who, if anyone, the creditor has authorized to collect the debt.

‚Ä¢Report the call. Contact the FTC and your state Attorney General's office with information about suspicious callers. Many states have their own debt collection laws in addition to the federal FDCPA. Your Attorney General's office can help you determine your rights under your state's law.",LPT: Make sure those Debt Collectors are real!,LifeProTips,False,1,1,1.0

How the rich avoid taxes is they basically take loans from banks on the basis of their assets like house, stocks, gold etc. They don‚Äôt sell any of these assets to generate cash flow because selling any of these will come with tax implication. So they keep these invested as it is and take out loans on them to run their life. No tax to be paid on loans and they get huge tax exemptions as well. This is what everyone should be doing, not only the financially literate. 

If you have a house that is paid up for, you should definitely take out a loan on it and invest the cash in stocks or business etc. Don‚Äôt leave an asset idle without making money out of it. And the assets like stocks, house or Gold appreciate in value so most of the times the interest you need to pay to the bank is more than offset by your asset appreciation itself. Don‚Äôt be in a hurry to re-pay the bank. The game is to pull out as much money from banks that can be given to you and use that effectively more than the interest of the banks. 

Of course most important is the loan you take should not be used to buy stupid things that depreciate like a car or fancy phones or watches etc. You can afford this to an extent but your asset needs to appreciate even more in that case to compensate for these expenditures. 

For people in the US if your student loan has the highest interest rate than bank loan rates then of course this is not applicable to you since best use of any additional cash flow for you guys will be to pay off the highest interest loan like the student loan you may have.",LPT: Learn to utilise Debt effectively to make money and avoid taxes.

Basically, the majority of jobs that are out there are not a good fit for you, and the majority of the ones that are sort of in your area aren't that good or are hard to get into due to promotions getting positions with tons of applicants and such. 

So, basically 10-20% of the jobs that look like you'd like are going to be actually good fits. Most of the other ones are kind of a waste of time.

Basically, that best match the following criteria:

* Few applicants.
* Does the job sound enjoyable?
* Is the pay decent or likely decent?
* Does the company do something you'd want to do?
* Could you talk more comfortably about the job/relate experiences naturally in an interview?

I've applied for very few jobs in my life and I have had several at this point, and this is the method I use.

I hope this helps you as well as employers, because someone who applies for jobs that are well suited for them will also be better employees. It's win-win to be a good fit - your employer makes more money off of you, and your performance is naturally better. You're also more likely to get the jobs you apply to by doing this.

This isn't the only technique, but it's perhaps the most important to being able to actually more easily write a cover letter.

Here's a project plan for finding a job as a bonus:

1. Spend a couple days just getting your resume in shape. Sleep on it, do it again. Make sure it's clear and descriptive and actually showcases your abilities and anecdotes.
2. Save 30-50 jobs on a job site like LinkedIn or Indeed. This might take an hour to find 30 that are decent.
3. Pick the top few out of that 30-50.
4. Write a cover letter for the top job out of those few. This might take a little while as well to get the first cover letter in good shape. Subsequent ones will be much easier.
5. Save that cover letter as a template for future cover letters.
6. Apply for that top job with the catered cover letter and resume.
7. Use the catered resume and cover letter as templates for the next one.",LPT: apply for the top few out of 30-50 saved job applications.,LifeProTips,False,1,1,1.0

As a someone that has reviewed hundreds of resumes and hired or rejected a lot, I would like to share the tips from a hiring manager pov. One of the most important thing that surprises me is the lack of candidates understanding of their own resume. 
 
Understand YOUR Resume

Your resume represents YOU and answers some of the questions before you show up for an interview but not all. Resume preparation is of utmost importance at all time.
Who      :  It tells me your name along with any contact details.
What     :  It tells me what your role was and the responsibilities that came with it.
When    :  It tells me the time period of your previous jobs. Your total job experience or if you are entry level
Where :  It tells me where you worked prior to this interview.
 
WHY and HOW are the two things that the resume WILL NOT answer and THAT‚ÄôS what the interview will be for. 
 
Understand YOUR Interview

While I know what you did, I do not know why you did it or how you did it. 
 
The WHY tells me your passion for the profession.  There is nothing wrong in exploring multiple career choices before you settle for the one you love or pays the most. Ideally your passion should pay the most.  But lets be realistic. So how adaptable are you? The energy you show in your answers to the interview question, tells me how passionate you are.  This one is a hit or miss.  Some candidates are quiet in their way but extremely passionate and it doesn‚Äôt show in the interview.  They end up doing a great job. Some candidates jump up and down in the interview but become grumpy after hiring them.  But please understand that energy levels are important in an interview.  Hiring managers take time of their work to sit in a conference room to talk to people they have only met through a resume.  There was a reason your resume got picked up.  You interview should match your resume or exceed it to be memorable among the many candidates. Keep in mind that in all the time it takes to find the candidate, the position continues to be empty and the work is done by others that might not be qualified to do.  
 
The HOW tells me if you are a team player.  Someone that engages others in getting a task done or is a solo act.  Nothing wrong with either.  Depends on how you present it. The HOW also answers me your threshold for risk taking and your understanding of the best use of time and resources. I will be looking to understand you more as a person and your learning curve.  Do you need a lot of hand holding or can you hit the road running.

Conclusion 
 
This tip is a tip of the iceberg.  There is a lot more to this so doing appropriate research helps quite a bit. There are also people far more qualified that can give even better suggestions. So take help if needed. 
 
I wish you all the success and hope this helped in a little way.
 
TLDR;   Treat your resume as an extension of YOU.  It answers some questions but not all. Make sure you put in the effort to understand your resume thoroughly. Attend interview confidently. Practice interviewing in front of a mirror if it helps.",LPT: Always keep your resume updated and understand what you have in your resume thoroughly BEFORE the interview.,LifeProTips,False,1,1,1.0

lksstsjp,t2_3w8zdg8b,1650786279,"1. Choose the _minimum_ amount of material that will get you the grade you need. This is the most important step. It requires doing a fair amount of research and speaking with advisors, mentors, and other students who have already taken the exam. Trying to do too much in an attempt to get a high grade is one of the most common reasons to fail these exams. You will get confused, overwhelmed, burned out, and most likely won‚Äôt even finish a single pass through the basic material. I‚Äôve made this mistake before, as have many of my brilliant, successful friends. 
2. Figure out how much you can realistically accomplish in one day by actually doing it, before you set up a plan. If you don‚Äôt live up to your expectations, rather than being angry at yourself for ‚Äúnot working hard enough‚Äù and promising to yourself that you will work harder tomorrow, either adjust the resources you use or schedule the exam for later to give yourself more time. 
3. If you can‚Äôt study for 6 hours straight, read 50 pages of thick material in one go, etc, then break the day into multiple study sessions. For example: study for 2 hours from 6-8am, then go to the gym and watch a netflix show, then study from 12-2pm, then take a nap or go out with a friend, then study from 6-8pm. Or use your work to give you the break (this is what I did. I studied for a bit before work, then on my lunch break, then when I got home).
4. In your study schedule, give yourself an extra day every week for the unexpected- a headache, family emergency, the need for just a day off, etc.
5. As you go along in your studying, mark the hard to remember stuff and make flash cards/whatever works for you (ideally some active form of learning). Re-review this a few days before your exam (not the night before).

This way, you end up with a successful and realistic strategy to get the grade you need. You will not stress about whether you are doing the right thing, you will not feel overwhelmed, you will not burn out, you will feel a lot happier through this process, and you will not fall behind.",LPT: Study strategy that minimizes stress and maximizes success for exams that cover massive amounts of material- from a professional tutor and a medical school graduate whipped with well over a decade of never-ending exams,LifeProTips,False,1,1,1.0

whenyesterdaywemet,t2_iy0cq,1650758566,"I preface this by saying everyone's grief is unique, and not all advice fits for every situation. That said, one of the biggest and most common mistakes I see when it comes to loss is denying the loss and the grief that comes with it.

What is grief? Grief is the intense physical and emotional response we experience when we lose something important. We most commonly think of grief as happening when we lose someone to death, but grief is common in many other situations. You will need to grieve when you fail at a dream, when someone you trust lets you down, when your understanding of the world is flawed, when a friend becomes unavailable, or there is a negative change in your life you cannot control. Sometimes, when I get very happy, I cry because I am grieving the fact I have not experienced that kind of happiness in a long time. Grief is weird. But it is a part of the human experience. 

We cannot control grief. Grief is a natural biological reaction to a dramatic change in our life. We cannot control our biology, rather, we evolved grief as a survival mechanism. Yes, grief actually helps us to thrive. When we deny our grief, it has numerous negative effects. It makes us miserable. It makes us angry at the world. It separates us from reality, and from connecting with our friends and family. It forces you to continue looking at the world from an old point of view, a framework which doesn't hold anymore given new evidence. When we deny our grief, we stay stuck in the past, not truly engaging in reality, but instead engaging with an old framework our subconscious knows is flawed. Instead of letting go and finding a new path forward, if we deny grief, we get angry at the world for not fitting our flawed framework. It's an unwinnable position, as the world will continue to disappoint us. 

Grief must be allowed space. If it is telling you to be sad, set aside time to cry. If it is telling you to be angry, find a pillow to shout into and a mattress to hit. When you engage your grief, saying everything that comes to mind without judgement. It doesn't matter if it makes sense. It doesn't matter if it is fair. Just get the poison of that old broken framework out. Seek out the company of loved ones. Talk about your grief with them. Get as much physical touch, like hugs, and arms around your shoulder, as you can. Grief may never completely leave you, but if you make space for it, it will leave you for a period and give you the space to move on. When we grieve, we recognize parts of the grief we no longer need to carry with us, and it gets lighter. Likewise, when we openly engage our emotions, we get stronger and more comfortable engaging them in the future. And the more we share with others, the less we have to carry on our own. 

**TL;DR** If you have experienced loss, you should try to take time to grieve. It doesn't have to be immediately after the loss. Sometimes we must continue to fight until we reach a safe place. But when we get to a safe place, and when those feelings start to well up, don't push them down. Allow yourself to ugly cry, allow yourself to yell into a pillow, and allow yourself to say everything you need to say to process, and give yourself space to grow and change.","LPT: Grief will follow you and weigh you down until you acknowledge it.

(personal summary of book ‚Äûatomic habits‚Äú. I recommend reading it)



# Step 0: Make it simple

Clearly define the habit you‚Äôre trying to form. Define it so precisely that a computer could start and end the habit. For example: Don‚Äôt plan to read every day. Plan to read every day at exactly 22:00 for exactly 15 minutes. Use a timer to always stop after 15 minutes.

If you notice that you missed your habit sometimes, don‚Äôt write it off as that you simply missed it. Adjust your habit routine so that you don‚Äôt need to do it at times you can‚Äôt / don‚Äòt want to do it. This helps because you never miss a habit with this procedure and it tells yourself that you execute your habits seriously.

Don‚Äôt waste too much time planning a habit though. *‚ÄúStandardize before you optimize. You can‚Äôt improve a habit that doesn‚Äôt exist.‚Äù*


# Step 1: Make it obvious

Use the first part of the habit loop ‚Äúcue, craving, response, reward‚Äù

Create one or more cues for you to remember to execute your habit. ‚ÄúThe most persistent behaviors usually have multiple cues‚Äù

### Examples:

- Create a reminder on your phone
- Make utensils for your habits visible and put them in the way of other things
- Link your habits to other habits you already have (habit stacking)
- Talk with others about your habit, this gives you social pressure to keep your habit going
- Prepare part of your habit beforehand


# Step 2: Make it attractive

For the second part of the habit loop to work, you need to make a habit attractive. This means that you look forward to doing it.

This can be achieved as follows:

### **Mix your habit with something you want to do.**

A television show encouraged their viewers to eat popcorn and drink wine white watching the show. This made them associate the show with something positive.

Be careful while implementing something similar yourself. The action may be conflicting with the identity you try to create with the habit. (Like eating ice cream after training)

**Examples from the book:**

1. After I get my morning coffee, I will say one thing I‚Äôm grateful for that happened yesterday (need).
2. After I say one thing I‚Äôm grateful for, I will read the news (want).
3. After I pull out my phone, I will do ten burpees (need).
4. After I do ten burpees, I will check Facebook (want).

(note: wtf is a burpee?)

### Assume a new identity and join a club

*‚ÄúYou are a reader. You are a musician. You are an athlete. When you join a book club or a band or a cycling group, your identity becomes linked to those around you. Growth and change is no longer an individual pursuit. We are readers. We are musicians. We are cyclists. The shared identity begins to reinforce your personal identity. This is why remaining part of a group after achieving a goal is crucial to maintaining your habits. It‚Äôs friendship and community that embed a new identity and help behaviors last over the long run.‚Äù* 


# Step 3: Make it easy

The best way to build a habit is repetition and the best way to learn is to practice, not to plan. Habits will get easier and will require less brain power the more you do it. The number of repetitions are more important than the length of one repetition for automation.

## Remove points of friction

One way of making a habit easier is to lighten the cognitive load. You can do this with priming your environment. That means making preparations and removing obstacles beforehand.

Create an environment where doing the right thing is the easier choice.


## Ritualize the beginning of a process

When trying to form a new habit but facing difficulties to keep your routine, try the two minutes rule:

Plan your habits so that they only take two minutes and make your habit very easy to start.

*‚ÄúAs you master the art of showing up, the first two minutes simply become a ritual at the beginning of a larger routine. This is not merely a hack to make habits easier but actually the ideal way to master a difficult skill. The more you ritualize the beginning of a process, the more likely it becomes that you can slip into the state of deep focus that is required to do great things. By doing the same warm-up before every workout, you make it easier to get into a state of peak performance‚Äù*

## Preparing one-time actions

*‚ÄúOnetime choices‚Äîlike buying a better mattress or enrolling in an automatic savings plan‚Äîare single actions that automate your future habits and deliver increasing returns over time.‚Äù*


# Step 4: make it satisfying

*‚ÄùWhat is rewarded is repeated. What is punished is avoided‚Äù*

## Track your progress

Seeing your progress is immensely satisfying and makes you not want to quit. Visual forms of measurement are some of the best ways to show progress. Some examples for tracking progress:

- Habit Tracker
- Making an X on a calendar for every completed set of a habit
- Seeing the page number go up after reading

## Never miss twice

It‚Äôs okay to miss your habit one time, no one‚Äôs perfect. It is however every important to take the habit back up as fast as possible. For that the rule ‚Äûnever miss twice‚Äú is beneficial.

## Stop when satisfying

Don‚Äôt put in more work and time in a habit than you plan. Preferably stop before your fully satisfied. ‚ÄúThe best way is to always stop when you are going good‚Äù


# How to break a habit

1. Make it invisible
    1. Put your phone outside your room when going to bed
    2. Hide things associated with a habit
2. Make it unattractive
    1. Highlight the problems / benefits from avoiding the habits
    2. Associate your habit with something negative
3. Make it difficult
    1. Increase the steps needed for a habit to start
        1. Take out batteries out of tv remote 
    2. Create a commitment device, restrict your choices to the favorable ones

Shuggah_Daddy,t2_ag5w5f70,1650740054,"# INTRODUCTION:

I just thought of this idea out of the blue and thought maybe I can share it here. It's regarding how to make waking up on time easy.

# SET-UP, THE WORKINGS OF THIS HACK:

Set your alarm the night before, and keep a water bottle next to the phone (not on your bed stand or whatever) and for the alarm text display write ""DRINK WATER NOW!"" or basically something that prompts your direction towards the bottle. Upon waking up, you should hopefully switch off the alarm and drink a decent amount of water.

Assuming you follow these basic (and easy) steps, two things will happen:

1. **Either**, you drink the water, but sleep afterwards.... (no problems) the water will soon wake you up as your urge to pee increases, thereby acting as a ""natural alarm"" if you will. In this case you're still waking up relatively on time.
2. **Or**, you drink the water, and in the process your body wakes up, as the water acts as a natural source to make you feel refreshed.

Either way, this simple DIY hack can help build the habit of waking up on time. Also, **bonus tip:** start with an easy target, if you have been waking up at 10AM, then perhaps start this water routine with say, 9:15AM or 9:30AM.... plus, this whole life hack is a double edged sword, as drinking water right out of bed is itself considered a very good habit.

# CONCLUSION

To be very honest with all of you, tonight will be the first night I'll try this myself. Today in the afternoon I was studying for my micro-econs exam, and this thought just randomly came to my mind  So, let's see how it goes haha

I live in North Carolina right now and have some decisions to make... I‚Äôve lived with my girlfriend for the past two years and it‚Äôs been a wonderful time but lately we‚Äôve been arguing a lot and its both our faults but I take more of the blame. I won‚Äôt get into it too much but she broke up with me and wants to live on her own. We had plans to move up north to a new apartment, together, at the end May. I don‚Äôt know what to do now. I had an internship lined up in Maryland and she also has job prospects lined up (i just turned 22 two weeks ago, i‚Äôm still in college. She is 22 and 7 months about.) I was mostly fine with the plan to go to Maryland to do the internship as I think its a great opportunity, but now i‚Äôd have to find my own place and figure out how to pay for it. I have friends here and a cousin and I don‚Äôt mind the school i‚Äôm at now ( if i moved to maryland I would stay there and finish up school there, starting over with social ties, etc) But the internship is a great opportunity but it sucks now that I won‚Äôt have my girlfriend by my side.

wiffleyourwaffle,t2_bk8ahmts,1650723046,"This is a hill I will die on. Heat your pizza up in the microwave until the cheese becomes melted and bread becomes soft (about 30-60 seconds per slice). The grease will usually make the bread slightly soggy, which is what you want to happen. Separately, heat up a pan on high heat until hot and place the microwaved pizza in the pan for about 30-60 seconds until the crust becomes stiff/slightly crispy. The grease helps this process, so no need to add anything on the surface of the pan. Use a spatula to remove the pizza from the pan. If it‚Äôs a high quality pizza it will taste exactly the same as when it was first made. If it‚Äôs a low quality pizza it will taste better than when it was first made. 

If you leave the slice in the pan for too long you‚Äôll harden the bread, dry out the sauce, burn the cheese and ruin your experience. Be sure to move the pan around the stove top burner because the center of the pan will have the most heat and you want to make the bread and crust of the pizza cook evenly and achieve equal crispiness.",LPT: The best way to reheat cold pizza is with a microwave and a stove top.

Shuggah_Daddy,t2_ag5w5f70,1650722748,"# INTRODUCTION:

It is natural to feel anxious, angry, sad, etc. on certain things or past events. Over thinking about a certain negative event that makes you bothered can lead to an overall reduction in productivity and generally just ruins your entire day. But **there is a solution** to this in my opinion.

# WHAT TO DO:

1. Take out a sheet of paper and pen (no, don't use your electronic devices, just plain and simple paper would do)
2. Write down your emotions, the storyline, a background of the event, or literally whatever comes to your mind. In other words, have a full fledged ranting session out for the paper, and don't leave any details out. 
3. After writing, just read the whole thing in your mind.... I would recommend you read it just once and fully. 
4. After reading, just tear the paper into tiny pieces and throw it away.

# LEARNING:

In my personal opinion, my overall mood improves a lot after this exercise and my focus on my work improves. Your mind needs an opening to rant it out, and a paper and pen are the most patient friends to rant to. Throwing and tearing the paper afterwards is a symbol of 'moving on'. 

# CONCLUSION

Spending 10 mins on this method is much better than ruining 10 hours. Maybe give it a try and see what happens. For me, this was a game changer. 

Lastly, if you use Brave Rewards, and you liked this post, it would mean a lot to me if you leave a tip for me as well :)","LPT: Here's a good way to control your negative emotions: I call this method the 'write, tear, and throw', read below:",LifeProTips,False,1,1,1.0

I'm from the middle east, from Lebanon. If anyone knows anything about Lebanon, it's been in a crisis for 3 years now and it keeps getting worse, but I also never had a good life there since I don't come from a good functioning family or even a rich family.

So, what I did for years is literally just grind (I'm a software developer). I grinded for years to get better in development and to eventually find a job in a western country. Eventually, this year I got a job in a western country, and I finally got the peace of mind that I have been trying to get for years. I was so miserable for more than 5 years and close to suicidal even.

But, for some reason I'm still not happy. I don't know what to do.. I have been going sightseeing mostly, but I haven't been in a relationship forever and since I just grinded for years, the only thing I find some enjoyment in is coding.
