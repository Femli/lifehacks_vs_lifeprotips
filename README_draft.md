### Introduction
Hi there, thank you for taking the time to read my work. This repository includes several notebooks that capture my entire analysis. The notebooks are prefixed from 0-6, and you can find them referenced below. If you wish to replicate this analysis, clone this repository and run each notebook in sequential order, 0 to 6.

|Index|Title|Description|
|---|---|---|
|0|[Workflow Functions]()| This notebook contains various custom functions that aid our analysis.|
|1|[Early Data Exploration]()| This notebook captures all the EDA that explored the numeric and categorical relationships with our model response.|
|2|[Feature Engineering]()| This notebook captures all the preprocessing and feature engineering performed on our training and test data splits.|
|3|[Model Benchmarks]()| This notebook captures several benchmarks that summarize the performance of our models on the engineered features.|
|4|[Model Insights]()| This notebook captures the assumptions analysis of our models.|
|5|[Production]()| This notebook captures the final model and inferences made from the coefficients.|
|6|[Kaggle Submission]()| This notebook is used to process final predictions on unseen data and format for kaggle submissions.|
